"Thank you for taking the time to visit this page in honor of Jake. 
  The Conde family is extremely grateful for each and every one of you.
    The saying "" It takes a village"" is definitely true in
  this situation. How does a family properly thank someone for the
  things that they have done to help out during difficult times?  You
  need to know how much all the prior well wishes, positive thoughts,
  prayers, donations, helping with meals, helping out with Lucas, gifts
  for Jake, time spent together, and friendship has meant to the Conde
  family - THANK YOU! Here we go again... Where do I even begin?  Honestly, it's really
  difficult to gather thoughts, considering so much has gone on the past
  77 weeks.  As most of you know, Jake was diagnosed with Ewing's
  Sarcoma in his left femur bone in April of 2015, when he was 9 years
  old. To keep it short, it was a very long year with many nights in the
  hospital, multiple biopsies, surgeries, chemo, lab/diagnostic testing,
  physical therapy etc.  It was a nightmare, but they got through it -
  or so they thought.  Shortly after his year long cancer treatment
  ended, Jake started having pain in his shoulder and losing weight, so
  they took him in for testing.  Then came the devastating news, which
  was even worse than the first time around.  Not only was his cancer
  back, they were told that Jake had 6 metastatic tumors. Cancer sucks!
  Sarcoma sucks! Many of you have emailed or left messages for Steph, Roger, and
  myself asking what you can do to help. First and foremost, for those
  of you who pray, please keep Jake in your daily prayers.  Jake has a
  birthday coming up, he turns 11 on October 22nd.  If you would like to
  send him a card or write him a note, you can mail it directly to his
  home, or contact me (my number is below) for more information. For
  those of you who would like to make a small donation, that would be
  great too. I know that they are spending thousands of dollars out of
  pocket each month. Currently Jake has had five in-patient chemo treatments (each 5 days
  long), and goes back in on Monday 10/17 for his sixth treatment.  A
  recent scan showed only 2 of his 6 tumors as active - this is good
  news!  The current plan is to give Jake 18 months of chemo - that's
  the bad news!  The chemo is taking a toll on him, the drugs are very
  hard on your body, it's been tough! In addition to chemo, the Conde family strongly believes in an
  alternative and holistic approach this time around; they believe
  that the chemo alone will not cure their son.  Jake is eating all
  organic and non-gmo foods, using essential oils, cannabis oil,
  juicing, drinking alkaline water & special teas, taking
  supplements... You name it, they're doing it! What the Conde family is going through is impossible to comprehend. 
  We've watched Jake go from being such a happy, funny, spirited
  child who was so full of life, to fighting for his life. What are the
  days during chemo and just after chemo like for them now?  At times
  Jake is screaming/crying in pain, has anxiety/fear of upcoming
  procedures/testing, vomits throughout the day, spends most of the day
  on the couch or in bed with no energy, is up sick most of the night,
  feels depressed, angry, and lonely at times. It stinks! It's really
  tough to see him/them go through this!  Roger and Steph are up around
  the clock caring for Jake, it's 24/7!  But, they continue to stay
  strong, believe in miracles, and have hope!  Losing is not an option! During Jake's first year of treatment Jake watched a lot of Adam
  Sandler movies in the hospital, Stephanie and Roger expressed how
  those movies helped them get through the awful hospital stays. 
  Laughter soothes the soul!  If you have any really good funny movie
  suggestions that are appropriate for an 11 year old, please make suggestions. The best therapy for Jake and family right now is for them to get out
  of the house (when Jake is feeling well), or to have company; they
  love to be around friends and family every chance they get. Even if
  it's for a short time.  Don't be afraid to reach out! We are all thankful for every minute, hour or glimpse of happiness
  that Jake feels. When he smiles, we all smile! Thank you for your concern and continued support.

"I have known Isaac for quite a few years.
    I found he was red green color blind when he mislabeled something
    purple that should have been blue.  He has always been one to lend a
    helpful hand and he loves people.  He volunteers at a kids Bible
    camp in the summer and doesn't have a lot of money.  He has made an
    impact in so many people's lives. This is a just a small thing we
    can do for him.  He doesn't even realize what he is missing. When he
    comes to volunteer at the camp's snow day, I would like to surprise
    him with Enchroma glasses so he can experience a more colorful

  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not

"For those of you that don't know me or know me well, three
      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this
        treatment. Protection of my girls, wisdom and patience for my
        husband, strength and peace for my mom, travel mercies,
        successful treatment, eradicating the cancer are just a few of
        the prayer requests I would ask of you. Thank you in advance for
        joining me in prayer. It is our most powerful weapon against the darkness. Psalm 46:1-7 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.[c] 4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 7 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . **NOTICE** King's College London will be closed for the
    holidays from December 23rd, 2017 to January 8th, 2018. Orders made
    during this time will be shipped out when the campus reopens on
    January 9th, 2018. Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"HOW IT ALL STARTED AND THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS My husband, Poh Teik “Jack” Teoh, age 63, was diagnosed with
    Stage 4 skin cancer in September 2017.  The cancer has spread to his
    spine and ribs and has severely weakened his body in ways that are
    distressing and heart-breaking for us both. The cancer started out as a very small growth on Jack’s right
    ear. It was initially diagnosed as a fungus infection and treated
    successfully with anti-fungal medication in the USA in the spring of
    2015.  In November of 2015, with great health and high expectations,
    we decided to follow our ultimate dream and set-up an import/export
    business in Penang, Malaysia; my husband’s birthplace. In Malaysia, the growth on Jack’s ear
    gradually came back so we sought medical help. The first doctor
    diagnosed the growth as cancerous. He recommended amputating the
    whole ear and scraping off the brain tissue surrounding the ear
    followed by plastic surgery to make a new ear.  We immediately
    sought a second opinion as the growth was very small. To us and many
    others this surgical solution was too severe and Jack’s overall
    health was excellent. The second doctor recommended a series of
    stronger medications including chemo pills. We followed this
    treatment and managed to keep the growth under control. We expected
    the growth would vanish just as it did in the USA In early 2017 my husband started to
    feel weak off and on with intermittent and sometimes indescribable
    pain. Jack managed to control the pain with prescribed medication
    and his own sheer will. We continued to work very hard at full speed
    to launch our import business, putting in our best effort with full
    enthusiasm to make our dreams come true.  Then in August, Jack
    suddenly became extremely weak, he lost his appetite completely and
    the growth started to spread at an alarming rate.   That’s when I
    admitted Jack into Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital here in Penang,
    Malaysia; an excellent hospital with a phenomenal medical staff. I
    moved into Jack’s hospital room the day he was admitted and have not
    left his side since. For the full medical diagnosis see the letter written by
      Jack’s doctor (Dr. Ho) below: THE REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF THE COME-BACK KID – THE FIRST 2
      MONTHS AT MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Due to the excellent care at Mount Miriam Cancer
    Hospital, in addition to Jack’s inimitable strength and fighting
    spirit, Jack has been able to consistently beat all odds and triumph
    over some very serious health issues. In early September, a few days
    after his first chemo infusion, he suffered a heart attack.
    Amazingly, Jack recovered and prevailed with willingness and
    strength. Just three weeks after his heart attack, Jack decided to
    continue the chemo (in a more gentler form) to resume his fight
    against his cancer. Due to a rapid loss of muscle mass and strength since August,
    Jack no longer has the strength to stand up on his own. He can only
    walk a short distance in our hospital room with a walker and the
    assistance of a therapist.  My husband is bound to the bed most of
    the time. He barely has enough strength to practice learning how to
    walk again.  But despite the severity of Jack’s condition, and the
    utter frustration he endures, he never fails to inspire others, make
    the doctors and nurses smile as they admire his remarkable strength
    and positivity. After the 4th chemo infusion on October 25th, Jack developed
    an infection that hit him fast and fierce. His oxygen levels dropped
    dramatically and he had extreme difficulty breathing. He was headed
    for the Intensive Care Unit at another hospital but thankfully the
    medical staff at Mount Miriam got the infection under control
    quickly and stabilized Jack beautifully.  Jack took a brief break
    from the chemo and agreed to resume the treatments on November 10th.
    As Jack said: “there is more positive than negative” and he chooses
    to continue what’s working for him and face every battle head-on. Dr. Ho & Jack Medical Attention ELLEN & JACK: MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER Born in the USA, I grew up Mountain
    Lakes, New Jersey and my husband Jack is from Malaysia.  We met in
    New Jersey in 2003 when Jack was living and working in New York. 
    From the very first day I met Jack he was always robust and full of
    life. He woke up every morning like it was Christmas, just like a
    child.  Jack is like a magnet, he’s irresistible, pulling people in
    with his charisma and zany sense of humour.  But what stole my heart
    is his heart. I have never met a person as self-less as my husband.
    He is someone I can trust with all my heart to do the right thing
    for anyone in any situation. Jack is a leader with a big heart; some
    would say a true warrior.  It’s absolutely heart-wrenching for me to
    see my husband suffer and become so weak and frail in such a short
    period of time.  He has spent a lifetime generously helping others
    and now is in great need himself.  I ask you to please help me help
    my husband, so he can beat this cancer and we can continue our lives
    as one.  This journey of recovery and healing will take time, but we
    both have a deep, enduring faith that we will prevail with the
    continuation of the excellent medical care at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital. Jack and me 2005 HELP NEEDED:  MEDICAL AND BASIC LIVING EXPENSES Due to the onset of Jack’s illness,
    the launching of our business was cut short, so we are not
    generating any income.  Due to my husband’s fragile and
    unpredictable condition, I am with him around the clock to make sure
    his special needs are met. I give him the peace of mind that I will
    never leave his side and the assurance he will always be safe.  With
    neither one of us working, continuing to pay for Jack’s medical
    expenses and our living expenses is an impossibility without the
    help of others. Not having medical insurance, we have received some
    financial help from the hospital’s social welfare department.
    However, it’s not enough and I am not sure if it will continue. We
    have monthly expenses in the USA that also add to our financial
    burden.  Witnessing my husband go through periods of anguish and
    taking care of him can be very stressful and exhausting. With your
    kind consideration and help, our financial stress can be alleviated.
    Your generosity would allow me to brave this journey with less
    pressure and more strength to support my husband with his medical
    and personal needs. Your financial help, and the spreading of my
    campaign on your social network, will be forever appreciated because
    I simply cannot do this alone.  Thank you ever so much. BREAKDOWN OF MONTHLY EXPENSES I NEED HELP WITH WHILE JACK IS HOSPITLALIZED Monthly Medical at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital: average of
      $7205.50 USD $8,451.00 USD (Sept) $5,960.00 USD (Oct) Monthly Malaysian Living Expenses (rent, utilities,
    internet/phones, transportation, food) :  $1,065.00 USD Monthly Upkeep of USA bills (car insurance, car
    loan, credit cards and storage space) :  $1,120.00 USD It’s very difficult to determine when
    Jack will be discharged and continue his treatments as an
    out-patient either from home or a step-down facility.  Just when it
    looks like a discharge is nearing, he has another set-back that
    requires intensive hospital care.  With more chemo on the way, I
    just don’t know what to expect and how his body will respond. We
    take it week by week, day by day. Jack started a 12-week course of chemo on September 29th.
    After he finished his 4th infusion on October 20th he had a set-back
    due to a serious infection but resumed his infusions on November
    10th. He recently finished his 6th chemo but is taking a break to
    garner some strength and a better appetite before he does the 7th
    chemo.  After this 12-week course is finished, there will be a
    reassessment and break before the next chemo course starts.  Then,
    after 6 months of chemo infusions there will be another reassessment
    to determine the next phase of treatment, which may include radiation. At this point in time, it’s impossible to determine our
    medical and living expenses after discharge. It all depends on how
    stable and self-sufficient Jack is at that time. I do know that it
    will take some time, months, for him to regain the strength
    necessary to walk on his own again.  If Jack is not re-admitted into
    the hospital, we will be looking at the following expenses. This is the best approximation I can give at this time: EXPENSES AFTER DISCHARGE FROM MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Live-in, Step-down Facility with Medical Care and Physical
    Therapy:   $1,125.00 USD per month (a step-down facility if
  necessary, or Jack can do his out-patient from home ) Monthly Malaysian Living Expenses when Living at Home (rent, utilities, internet/phones, transportation,
    food): $1,215.00 USD Monthly upkeep of USA bills (car insurance, car
  loan, credit cards and storage space) :  $1,120.00 USD Basic Medical Supplies Needed at Home:  $436.00 USD
  min (wheelchair, walker, commode, air cushion mattress) Monthly Physical Therapy & Visiting Nurse at Home: 
    $705.00 USD Monthly Out-Patient Expenses at Mount Miriam Hospital: approximate range of $1,143.00 to $2,755.00
  USD (doctor appointments, blood tests, chemo infusions,
  blood transfusions, ear dressings, medications) Radiation:  $2,000 USD (one time charge) When a donation is made, the money will be accepted by PayPal
    and then deposited into my USA bank checking account.  With my USA
    checking account debit card, I can pay for Jack’s medical expenses
    here at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital.  From my Malaysian bank, I can
    also withdraw cash (in the form of Malaysian Ringgits) from my USA
    checking account and this will allow me to pay for our apartment
    rent, utilities, food and transportation expenses.  I can also pay
    my USA debts directly from USA checking account. The following fees are deducted from each donation (USA &
    Canada): Fundrazr : 5% PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30 Total
    deducted from each donation:  7.9% + $0.30 International fees:  Fundrazr 5%  &  PayPal 4.3% to 4.5% + $0.30 Calling on all Angels with a giving
    heart. Due to my desperate situation, this is the first time I have
    ever done a fundraiser.  As my social network is small, I would
    greatly appreciate your help in sharing my campaign.  I just do not
    know what lies ahead in medical expenses, it’s very hard to predict.
    The hospital has been understanding of my financial situation but
    does expect a significant payment every 2 to 3 weeks. I greatly appreciate your kind consideration in supporting me
    & donating to the best of your ability in this critical
    situation.  Thank you all so very much. With Great Appreciation & Love, Ellen","5,605",of $125k goal,https://fundrazr.com/HelpEllenSupportJack,Bridge Over Troubled Water for Jack,28,,U.S. Dollar
"My parents have had a rough month. In the past month, my parents
  traveled to Texas, twice, due to two unfortunate deaths of my Dad's
  neice, then two weeks later, his sister also passed away. Two weeks
  after returning to the Chicago area, my Dad nearly died after eating,
  yes eating! He had food stuck in his esophagus and tried to wash it
  down and ended up causing his esophagus to burst from the pressure
  (esophageal perforation of the thoracic region and left lung). This
  occurred the Friday after Thanksgiving. After being disagnosed with
  the large tear in his esophagusand adjacent lung, in the thoracic
  region (behind the heart), he was transferred to Rush Memorial
  University Medical Center where he would have died if the emergency
  surgery had not been conducted. He was sedated for two days while intubated. He is battling
  infection, high blood pressure and fluid in his lungs. He is
  conscious, but in no way out of the woods. Due to the nature of this
  injury, he will most likely remain in ICU for another week and in
  hospital for a couple weeks after that. This is where, on behalf of my
  parents, I am asking for support during this holiday season. While my
  parents both have jobs, they have exhausted all their vacation time
  and are currently both without income until the New Year. While there are benefits my Dad will most likely qaulify for, those
  applications and approvals take time. My mother is working with her
  employer to work from home, but she cannot do that until my Dad is
  released from the hospital. My parents are never ones to accept
  financial support, they are often the ones donating to causes and to
  others in need. I can attest that any donations accepted are beyond appreciated and
  will go directly to living expenses. The last thing I want my Dad to
  worry about, when he is fully aware of what is happening, is how his
  injury has caused him to be unable to work. The surgeons keep reminding my mom this is still a life threatening
  injury. I can't make him heal or expedite the recovery. What I can do
  is shed light on their situation and help alleviate one of the stressors. Any contribution is greatly appreciated and if you are unable to
  contribute, sharing this fundraiser is just as appreciated. Thank you so very much, Kristen Meghan","1,463",,https://fundrazr.com/Dennistague,Help the Tague's get through this trying time.,,"Jan 26, 2018",

"Hi, I’m Claudia, Abi's mother, Abi suffers from a weird disease
    here in México called Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy Charcot
    Marie Tooth ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcot%E2%80%93Marie%E2%80%93Tooth_disease ). It's more common in Europe And The United States Abi was born like a normal person. She used to climb a lot, to
    run, to jump, to swim ... until one day at the age of 5 years old I
    saw that she started limping and walking in 1000 different ways
    until she ended up walking like a duck - with both feet sticking out. Then I started to visit a bunch of the best doctors in the
    country to find an answer until they told me it was a weird
    hereditary progressive disease with no cure. They told me that her
    life since that day would be limited. She would need to be cared for
    24/7 as well as daily therapies that would help her to continue
    walking. Since that day I have been taking care of Abi 24/7. Over time her disease has evolved, making almost all of her
    muscles from half thigh to the toes disappear. There is no muscles
    from the knees to the toes it's like the bottom part of her knees
    doesn't exist. By the evolution of the disease, the doctor told me that she
    needs a new orthosis because of her height (1.75m) and weight (69kg)
    she has. The orthosis that she have right now does not do the function it
    used to do. The new orthosis we want to buy will give her more support and
    stability for her actual weight and height. Right now she is in bed
    because she fell last Monday and she broke her ankle. The reason why was because her orthosis that she has currently
    does not work properly. Unfortunately a fall for her it is extremely
    dangerous. However for normal human beings a fall is nothing. If we
    break one of our bones we just rest and will get well soon. For Abi
    it is different. She would have to rest for 2/3 months while missing
    out school and possibly losing the capacity she has to walk. I have no one to support me. This illness is not only hard work
    but is also time consuming. The father quit four years ago and so
    have all our family members. The government here do not support you
    with anything. It is just Abi, my son and me. Because Abi requires
    24/7 care I am not able to get a job. I can’t just leave her in the
    house home alone. I have had to sell my car to survive some months
    which has affected the care and the therapies that she needs. That
    is why I beg you to help to buy her a new orthosis so she can
    continue walking, to see the possibility to have a used car so I can
    take her to the therapies and school, so she can continue walking
    some steps, so she can start so she can start high school, continue
    studying and continue having excellent grades and adjustments in the
    house (a special bathroom and a ramp). She has an intact
    intellectual capacity that the disease can not touch and according
    to medical diagnosis, it will not touch. This is why I fight, so
    that she can have a normal life and not be locked up at home because
    she can’t walk. Please pray for Abi. Share this with all your friends and
    familiars so that we can get the goal and let Abi have a better
    life. We just want her to be able to walk like any other person.

"Le 23 janvier 2012, la vie d'Anne a
    basculé. Son corps a déclaré forfait et la douleur chronique s'est
  installée , de la tête aux pieds. Bouger est devenu un cauchemar
  lancinant... et danser, un souvenir douloureux. Pourquoi aider Anne? Traiter la douleur chronique est une bataille longue et coûteuse.
  Pour nous, depuis 2012, ce combat se chiffre à quelque 60 000
  $ : médicaments, examens, consultations, équipements
  spécialisés, frais de toutes sortes... Toutes nos économies y sont passées. À cause de sa maladie, Anne a été contrainte d'arrêter de travailler.
  Depuis 2012, elle n'a aucun revenu . À deux reprises,
  elle a fait une demande de prestations pour invalidité. À deux
  reprises, on la lui a refusée. À deux reprises, elle a demandé l'aide
  de son CLSC afin d'obtenir des services de soutien à domicile. Les
  deux fois, on les lui a refusés. Depuis bientôt cinq ans, Anne n'a eu
  d'autre choix pour vivre que de vider son bas de laine ,
  s'endetter, et se ruiner en médicaments, suppléments, examens
  médicaux, frais de déplacement, équipements spécialisés... Sans
  compter les nombreuses listes d'attente (hôpitaux et centres de
  réadaptation) auxquelles elle est ""abonnée""... Une lueur d'espoir Depuis août 2016, pour la première fois en quatre ans, Anne bénéficie
  de soins cohérents et coordonnés qui lui permettront
  de reprendre sa vie en main. Ces traitements s'étaleront sur plusieurs
  mois et coûtent beaucoup de sous... que nous n'avons plus. Grâce à
  votre générosité, Anne pourra poursuivre ses traitements (physiatrie,
  podiatrie, physiothérapie, ostéopathie), payer ses médicaments, et
  améliorer sa qualité de vie. Anne St-Denis Trente années durant, Anne a enseigné aux femmes le stretching-danse.
  Elle a entrepris sa carrière de pédagogue à l’âge de 15 ans. Elle a
  successivement enseigné dans les centres communautaires, les écoles,
  les milieux du sport professionnel (RIO, CEPSUM), de la santé
  (Institut de Cardiologie de Montréal, Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de
  Montréal) et de l'enseignement supérieur (Université de Montréal). Au début des années 2000, Anne dirigeait sa propre école. Enseigner
  était sa passion, une passion que ses élèves lui rendaient bien. Ses
  classes remportaient un franc succès, année après année. Dans ses
  cours, Anne faisait découvrir, avec l'énergie qui la caractérise, le
  bonheur de bouger et de danser. Communicatrice hors pair, elle
  permettait aux femmes de se mettre en forme, de s’exprimer à l’aide de
  leur propre langage corporel, d’affirmer leur féminité, d’acquérir et
  garder confiance en elles. Courage et détermination Anne a un message d'espoir à transmettre aux gens qui, comme elle,
  souffrent de douleur chronique. Un message d'autant plus fort qu'il
  s'appuie sur une expérience vécue alliant courage, résilience, et une
  irrésistible soif de vivre. Anne ne peut plus enseigner le
  stretching-danse? Qu'à cela ne tienne : elle peut parler,
    partager, faire profiter à ceux aux prises avec la douleur
  chronique de l'expérience qu'elle a acquise dans la gestion de ses
  propres douleurs. Pour ce faire, Anne a de grands et beaux projets :
  écrire un livre (qu'elle achève de dicter) et offrir
  des ateliers-conférences destinés aux personnes aux
  prises avec cette terrible maladie. Vous arrive-t-il... Écoutez le témoignage d'Anne Consultez le blogue d'Anne --------------------------------------- Faites connaissance avec Anne . Comme moi, vous
  serez convaincus qu' elle peut s'en sortir , travailler

"My name is Manichanh, I am a part of a
  small group of health care workers whom are dedicated to improving
  lives of those less fortunate. In addition to assisting locally, we
  also travel to one of the poorest neighborhoods in Guatemala where we
  support The School of Hope  and Rekko Clinic. http://www.eftc.org.uk/our-work and http://www.rekko.org/index_en.html We are making our annual trip to Jocotenango, Guatemala in September
  2017.  We support a program that improves the lives of hundreds of
  improverished children. We cover our own travel and all associated
  expenses. We are asking you to help us raise funds for this school so
  that the children can obtain medical care at local clinics and
  hospitals. We continue to work with a local clinc and strengthen those
  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679
      students across the Foundation. On November 18, 2017 we are hosting a fundraiser at the Yakima Sports
  Center. We will be sharing our stories while hosting a silent auction,
  having a split the pot or 50/50 (winner took home almost $200 last
  year!) and games. Please help us with this fundraiser that will enable
  hundreds of impoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. In order to improve a population you need
  empowerment and independence. The proven form has been education.
  These children face countless socioeconomic and psychological
  barriers. A holistic approach is required to improve longterm
  outcomes. What these children face on a near daily basis makes all of
  our life obstacles seem pity. The staff and volunteers provide long
  term commitment. They genuinely care and love the community in which
  they are empowering. They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long
  term and sustainable commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless
  these socioeconomic issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any
  donation is greatly appreciated. These children are combating extreme
  poverty and many face inhuman conditions. This school provides a safe
  haven where they can break the cycle of poverty. All donations go
  directly to medical cost and does not cover any administration fees.
  We have never needed as much support as we are asking for this year.

      had a rough year in terms of work, medical procedures, lack of

      it out of the heel cord surgery we've been anticipating for months. We found out that Ethan has an

      will need more surgery. Right now, Ethan is not allowed
      to put any weight on his feet at all, meaning, I must stay home
      with him 24/7 in case of fire or emergency. I have to bathe him,
      help him use the restroom, dress him, feed him, and administer his
      medication, all while still attending online courses. I applied for SSI for Ethan
      over 3 months ago. I have received no response and cannot get
      through to the office. I have written to Senator Tim
      Scott, asking for any information that would point me in the right
      direction for any grants or funding that our particular situation
      could be eligible for. I have also written to the White House with

      am actively taking college courses. Ethan's father has never paid
      child support and I cannot pursue him for financial assistance
      since he is not a US citizen. There must be something we are
      eligible for??!! One would think, right? Well, I have yet to find anything. I have always worked. I have
      always been Ethan's provider with the help from immediate family
      when really needed. Ethan does have Medicaid and we
      finally received food stamps. But what of rent? Utilities?
      Toiletries? School supplies? Anything that we cannot eat? It is not anyone's
      responsibility, and I absolutely hate that this is the place I
      have to turn AGAIN since I am not eligible for help since
      I am physically capable of working. Apparently, our situation falls
      in some grey area and no one can really give me an answer on how I
      can find help. If anyone knows of someone who
      can help us find these answers, Please let me know, as I am out of ideas. Once again, We thank you and
      love you so much for all of your continued support and, once more,
      I would never ask unless absolutely urgent and necessary. Thank you all... again. Please share, as the more who
      know, the better chance we can find some answers. Love, Steph and Ethan PS. Ethan is feeling much
      better and is taking this all so well, considering! He is an

"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

"Elizabeth Ozuna regiomontana de nacimiento, maestra de profesión y
  apasionada por dejar su legado a muchos niños en el mundo y a toda
  persona que toca en su camino. Por circunstancias familiares emigro a los Estados Unidos y se
  reinventó a si misma al lado de sus hijos Gustavo, Erick, Lizbeth y su
  esposo Humberto. Como muchos inmigrantes empezaron desde abajo,
  tratando de construir un mejor futuro para sus hijos. Tuvieron que
  enfrentar una nueva manera de hacer las cosas y aprender un nuevo idioma. Junto a su esposo crearon la revista” Mi Familia Magazine” cuyo
  objetivo es ayudar a los latinos que migran a Estados Unidos a
  empoderarse para salir adelante y recuperar los valores familiares. Crearon también el premio “Mujer Admirable” buscando hacer visibles
  los esfuerzos y talentos de la mujer latina en los Estados Unidos.
  Premio que se otorga a mujeres admirables, al igual que ella, desde
  hace más de dos décadas. Todo iba bien, pero el 14 de abril de este mismo año, Elizabeth fue
  diagnosticada con mieloma múltiple, una especie de cáncer.  Su familia
  se cimbró de miedo al enfrentar una realidad tan triste. El suelo se
  movió para ellos sin previo aviso. Elizabeth no podía enfocarse entonces solamente en buscar opciones
  de tratamientos para su enfermedad, seguía trabajando al lado de su
  esposo para sacar adelante su familia y al mismo tiempo encabezar un
  Grupo de apoyo y oración en Houston, Texas. Fue su fe, la que llevó a Elizabeth a contestarle al médico que le
  dio el diagnóstico: Yo puedo con ésto. Ni ella misma supo de donde
  salió esa repuesta. Lo que siguió fueron entradas y salidas de salas
  de emergencia, estudios pesados y dolorosos. Dolor extremo, confusión
  mental y paralización momentánea de algunas partes de su cuerpo. De ser una mujer independiente enfrentó entonces como agua helada
  al rostro, la dependencia total de su esposo Humberto; que con amor y
  paciencia se convirtió en su principal aliado. Los gastos se
  triplicaron y las ingresos no alcanzaban al no poder estar tan al
  pendiente de su negocio. Es entonces, que Todos Unidos por un solo Corazón, surge como
  iniciativa del Grupo de compañerismo y oración  guiado por Elizabeth
  Ozuna en Houston, Texas para tratar de obtener fondos y apoyarla en 
  este difícil camino para alcanzar su salud. Su cuerpo resistió 19 quimioterapias inyectadas en el estómago y
  algunas dosis de radiación tomada, antes de colapsar. Hoy, Elizabeth Ozuna se encuentra internada en el Hospital San
  Vicente de la ciudad de Monterrey, después de sobrevivir una crisis de
  meningitis provocada por la baja de defensas de su organismo
  provocadas por el mieloma múltiple. Ely lucha por su vida, aferrada a su fe, junto con el apoyo de su
  familia y amigos que le agradecemos su existencia y aprendizajes que
  nos ha dejado. Hagamos llegar a Elizabeth y Humberto Ozuna, a sus tres hijos
  nuestras oraciones y nuestro apoyo monetario para cubrir los costos
  del Hospital en Monterrey, NL. Mexico y de traslado a Houston, Texas. No hay recursos que alcancen, Hoy, Todos Unidos por un solo Corazón
  los invita a extender su mano generosa y apoyar a la familia con la
  cantidad que les sea posible o que les indique su corazón. Ely se envuelve en cada batalla en el amor de su familia y las
  promesas de DIOS. Se reviste con la palabra del Padre reflejada en el
  Salmo 91: No temerás el terror de la noche, ni la flecha que vuela de día, ni la peste que acecha en las sombras ni la plaga que destruye a mediodía. Podrán caer mil a tu izquierda, y diez mil a tu derecha, pero a ti no te afectará. Ya que has puesto al Señor por tu refugio, al Altísimo por tu protección,ningún mal habrá de sobrevenirte, ninguna calamidad llegará a tu hogar. Porque él ordenará que sus ángeles te cuiden en todos tus caminos. Con sus propias manos te levantarán para que no tropieces con piedra alguna.

"I live in a country where LGBT people are persecuted by law, and
  finding skilled doctors who are LGBT-friendly is incredibly difficult.
  Trans people in particular encounter extreme difficulties when seeking
  doctors for transitioning treatment and gender reassignment surgery. I've managed to find a doctor who's skilled and experienced at FtM
  top surgery (gender reassignment procedure for transgender men that
  creates a masculine chest), and I've been saving for a few years to be
  able to undergo the procedure. I have been informed, however, that the doctor will be retiring soon,
  and it is likely that he will decide to retire early, as early
    as next year. His colleagues and other known doctors in the country charge double
  of his fee, and he's one of the best local surgeons when it comes to
  FtM surgery. My hope is that I am able to undergo the procedure before he
    retires, and I'm aiming to get it done by January 2018. I've saved up enough to be able to pay the deposit and travelling
  costs (the doctor is based at a different state), but I cannot
  possibly afford having the surgery this year with my existing funds. The goal is USD 900 by 31 December 2017. This FundRazr is to cover the rest of the medical fees, and for
    an overnight stay at the hospital after the surgery. Follow-ups are

"Hello! My name is Yvonne Foong, I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis type
  2 when I was 16 years old with hearing and vision damaged. It causes
  tumours to grow anywhere in my brain, along with the spinal cords and
  peripheral nerves. So far I have had 20 different surgeries to safely
  remove the tumours whenever needed to preserve my life. In the end of 2017, I need to undergo surgery again to remove
  multiple large tumours called schwannoma from both my arms. They have
  made my fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I lose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared
  of well in the ward. My vision became damaged as a result, I have had
  to adapt by getting help from people to do my work and in order to
  stay productive, while my mother started having to prepare my daily
  living needs despite her advanced age.  So I must go for surgery with
  doctors who can do better to save my arms before it is too late. Some brief details about the surgery: Where: St Vincent Medical Center, Los Angeles. By Who: Dr. Gregory P Lekovic, Neurosurgeon. When: In the end of 2017 For Malaysian supporter, you may contribute to my local bank account: Name:  Foong Ming Niang Public Bank Berhad:  6887203135 or you may also watch the video below to understand my family
