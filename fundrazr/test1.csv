"My name is Harley Hendrix and I am creating this campaign for a
  coworker and friend, Katsumi Edamatsu, and his family. His 15 year old son, Ryoya, was diagnosed with cancer..bone cancer
  discovered first in his knee and is scheduled for surgery in Los
  Angeles in September. The Edamatsu family (Kats' wife and their other
  3 children) are in LA receiving the care his son needs for his cancer. Katsumi is now maintaining his expenses for his home in New Jersey

  that he can work and earn a paycheck which pretty much is eaten up by flights. I know that Katsumi will do all he can in order to cure his son of
  this unspeakable and horrific disease but we need your help, friends,
  to alleviate the financial burden this has placed on his family. Let's all show Katsumi how much he is loved and what true friends do

"For those of you who do not know Ben Durst personally, I am sorry.
  For those of you that do know Ben, I am still sorry. But you know
  why..... (lol) Ben hit a cold reality when he was recently diagnosed with bladder
  cancer. It was a shock to say the least. He is too young and not ready
  to stop making people laugh. He wants to fight.  But he has a problem..... Ben is on Medicare. He does not have prescription drug coverage. The
  one medication he has to take at home to build his white blood cells
  after the chemo kills them off is $4,752 a prescription. He has 7
  refills. That's $33,264 for this prescription for his 4 cycles of
  chemo, and the month after. If he does not get this medication, the
  chemo will surely kill him. This medication will help him fight off
  infection since his white blood cells will no longer have those
  capabilities. There are organizations that will help, and he is in
  communication with them.  However, they are slow to reply and he needs
  to be sure he has financing. He was able to get the first prescription free. Ben has always had 2 goals in life... The first goal is to laugh and
  make others laugh. He went to the hospital telling people he was
  worried about a certain test because he didn't get to study for it. Of
  course, everyone laughed. He loves having parties and getting family
  together. He is always there for his Mom Evelyn, and his sister Lisa.
  He takes care of me, the house and my parents. Ben is a big guy with
  an even bigger heart. His other goal is to work. He is a truck driver and loves being on
  the road. He makes overnight deliveries while seeing the country. An
  active member Fraternal Organization of Eagles #3138 (Taylor, MI), he
  has often stopped in clubs around his delivery locations just to
  support the organization. All he wants to do now is get back to work
  and feel whole again. I am Suzette Pariseau and I have been Ben's better half for more
  than 6 years.  I am an ESL teacher and can take time off work to help
  him, but I do not get paid for the time I take off. Financially, I
  have to take care of our regular bills to keep us afloat.  Ben is also
  a proud man and would never ask for monetary help, so I am doing it
  for him. If you can donate and help him pay for his medications, it
  would be greatly appreciated.  Any amount would help. If you need any
  more information than what I have already posted, or would prefer to
  send a donation via snail-mail, please email me at parisuze@yahoo.com , or Cancer2017SUCKS@yahoo.com . Thank you for your generosity. Everyone loves a comedian.

"I made this fund to help out Kainin with the medical expenses of her
  mother. From this point on, I'll let her explain the full situation: ""Normally I am not one for these, but financial situations
    have changed. As some of you may know, back at the beginning of the
    year, my mother was informed she has cancer. She has the cells, but
    thankfully they haven't mutated over. Doctors have her on treatment,
    but they have cautioned her against over stressing, as that may
    cause the cells to mutate. Unfortunately, with my mothers other
    health issue, stress is par for the course. Years ago, she was in an
    accident, where she tore all the ligaments in her neck. She has to
    see a specialist every 2-3months, for botox injections to her neck,
    to temporarily restore use of those ligaments. Normally, this is
    covered under her health insurance. However, when she switched to a
    more local specialist, they handle the billing differently. My
    mother was paying out of her pocket, and not being reimbursed the
    full amount. This has since been fixed, but she was not compensated
    those initial payments. To put it into perspective, each vial of
    botox is $700, and she needs about six. (It's 12 injections to the
    neck). I only ask for help, because I can no longer afford to help
    her with the debt, due to my reduction of hours. And I don't want my
    mother over stressing, and risking the cancer becoming active.""","1,975",of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/c1IiS8,Please Help My Mother,21,,Canadian Dollar
"Bob Sobo has been a servant of God and of people throughout his whole
  adult life.  He’s been an Associate Pastor, Senior Pastor and Shelter
  Manager for the San Fernando Valley Rescue Mission where he helped
  many homeless families get back on their feet.  Bob has also had a
  passion for music since boyhood, and he achieved professional status
  as a guitar player and songwriter. Bob has also been a devoted husband and father. He has dedicated his
  life to the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom; and yet that pursuit has
  never made him cold or impersonal.  Anyone who has heard Bob laugh
  knows this to be true!  His wry humor and rapier wit have the capacity
  to put any person at ease, as anyone who has spent time with him can
  attest to. Sadly, in December of 2006 when Bob was just 52, he was diagnosed
  with Parkinson’s Disease. Doctors believe that the onset was
  exacerbated by a head injury Bob incurred in a tragic traffic
  collision with a negligent driver in October of that year. This terrible accident occurred as he was heading to a musical gig. 
  Then, like now, he was accompanied by the incomparable Sandy Howell,
  who thankfully incurred only minor injuries.  As a result of that
  accident, the Parkinson’s which would most probably have laid dormant
  for the majority of Bob’s life, surfaced with a vengeance. This disease has exacted a terrible toll on Bob. The first thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  make music with his guitar.   The loss of that light within the world
  has been immeasurable; anyone who has spent any time with Bob knows
  that a guitar in his hands is like a painter with fresh watercolors,
  staring at a beautiful vista… His ability to make that instrument sing
  shaped the majority of my childhood, and it was a shock to everyone
  around him when he couldn’t play anymore. But Bob persevered. The next thing that Parkinson’s took from Bob was his ability to
  drive and speak publicly. Everyone was taken by surprise at how Bob’s
  Parkinson’s advanced so quickly, and in such a degenerative manner. 
  Nonetheless, with the help of a few friends, family, and Ms. Sandy
  Howell, Bob was able to continue. Bob persevered. Despite all efforts to the contrary, things have gotten worse for
  Bob.  As a result, he now requires round-the-clock, live-in caregivers
  who assist him in all regular daily functions.  The financial
  assistance that is available to him through normal channels just is
  not at all sufficient to cover his medical and care costs.  He is
  desperate need of additional funding, and he has no means to procure
  it for himself.   He has had some additional help from a kind
  benefactor, but this major portion of his funding is going to come to
  an end, soon. So—the question becomes:  does anyone out there want to help out
  Bob?  He needs your help in order to persevere further.  He is working
  with therapists and doctors, and doing his best throughout all of
  these trials and tribulations.  Will you stand with him?  Can you? He doesn’t want to be in the position where he needs to ask for
  help.  Unfortunately, it’s gotten to the point of him actually needing
  to do so in order to survive.  I know it’s a lot to ask for in this
  day and age; we all have our issues and problems.  Trouble doesn’t
  discriminate, as I’m sure we all know. But Bob needs some help.  Please do what you can.  Let’s help Bob
  persevere further.   On his behalf, I thank each and every one of you
  for your time.  C’mon, let’s do this!","14,180",of $50k goal,https://fundrazr.com/adLI0,Please Help Bob Continue Fighting Parkinson's!,66,,U.S. Dollar

"Drew Aufderheide was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago with a rare and
  incurable form of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per
  year in the United States are diagnosed with this disease and because
  the cancer is caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure
  it - only medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is
  extremely rare for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia. 
  It is normally diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the
  life expectancy is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot
  of unknown facts surrounding Drew's case because physicians and
  oncologists do not often see CML in someone so young and because of
  Drew's young age, his life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val, who have been married for
  four years. With this medication comes side effects that he must
  manage.  Drew has met this challenge with his usual strength of
  determination, peace of soul, his faith in God and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have

"Our story begins with love. I pray that it would touch your heart. On
  July 16, 2004 I met Aidin, my best friend. The first day we met, was
  the first day that I recognized love. We married 4 years later at Lake
  Mead, NV, during a sunset and standing over a cliff. It was a memory
  that will never leave my mind. From that day forward we knew we wanted
  to be a family but life threw us obstacles. I was diagnosed with 2 grapefruit sized tumors on my ovaries which
  had to be removed ASAP. While in recovery, my husband and I were told
  news that killed all hope for a baby. Due to the size, shape and
  placement of my tumors, the surgeon deemed it medically necessary to
  remove my right ovary and my tubes. We had no hope of a successful
  tubal reversal as the tube on my left was full of scar tissue and had
  no hope of repair. We were absolutely devastated. It wasn’t until 6
  months ago that we have given IVF a thought. After discussing this
  with my OB/GYN, she stated that since I still had my left ovary, I
  would be a good candidate for IVF. Hope renews itself! So with the
  summary of our story, we have had numerous obstacles to overcome, and
  financially speaking, this is another one. We thank all hearts for
  those who have read our story, and donated to our future baby. Any
  amounts $1-$10,000 is a blessing to us. We thank you from the bottom

  in 2009. I'm a digital marketer and  a wedding photographer and she is
  a dentist with specialty in orthodontics. 2. When we were 1 year into our marriage Jessica was diagnosed with
  MS because she started to get vertigo and went tired pretty quickly.
  Things escalated fast and by the next year the was on a wheelchair. So
  we started looking for treatment, fortunately we eventually found a
  drug that does very well with her, she changed all her alimentation
  habits and with therapy she walked again, with difficulty but can do
  must of the tasks and have mostly a normal life. 3. The money is because the drug is about $4000 USD monthly (is
  called Gilenya /Fingolimod) and plus the therapies and other drugs for
  symptoms things are getting harder for us, also she suffers from a lot
  of spasticity and only canavis treatment can help her with that, the
  problem is the closest place for her to get it is in the united states
  in California, so we need funds for that also. 4. We are looking for this alternative as a new option for us to keep
  going with the best life quality we can get, to make her believe that
  even if things are complicated there's always a way to confront the darkness. 5. We want to ask for your support and to really offer you that
  anytime you come to Mexico city come with us so we can get you to know
  the city maybe Jessica can check your teeth and I can do some cool
  portraits of you and your family. We know there are lots of people out

"Today I was confronted with my problem again, which is deuteranomaly
  (a type of red-green blindness), so I began to research again and
  found enchroma which I already know of for a long time already but
  never thought of getting it because of the high price. I remember the
  first time I saw videos of people using enchroma glasses and their
  reaction is just phenomenal. ""Deutans are people with deuteranomaly, a type of red-green
  color blindness in which the green cone s do not detect enough
    green and are too sensitive to yellows, oranges, and reds."" In design, color theory is a big part of the process that I will
    never master, I thought - since I have deuteranomaly. But still I
    try my best to do my design and choose the colors that I am
    confident with. Since I still see ""most"" colors except for
    the ones between red and green, I still can differentiate most of
    the colors but I am very limited to the choice of the tone. I never
    can be sure that it is a good combination, so I usually look up
    color schemes by other designers instead of creating my own set of
    colors which is disappointing to me. But it's my only resort if I
    want to have a good work unless I ask my friends/family (usually my
    sister haha). So anyone who want to help me, can feel free to donate something. I
    set the goal to $250. A pair of enchroma glasses can cost up to
    $430, but I will pay for the rest by myself. I didn't want to just
    let other people pay all for me, but still would appreciate your help. I don't expect much, just thought I would give it a try. Thank you.

    read at the color reveal (we can have a party if everyone wants) and
    a recording will be posted for ALL to see! Thank you for your time
    and contribution. As many may not know, Andy is colorblind to a large degree. He
      found out in high school and it began to effect him immediately. Andy served for the US National Gaurd as a medic and served a
      tour in Iraq. He wanted to fly planes like his dad but the color
      blind can't fly. after returning home Andy decided to work with plants. Being a
      medic in a war made it hard to be a medic to the public. He began
      a degree in Agronamy. Not soil science like he wanted. after 3 years of working with plants and on fields it has
      occurred to him his eyes would fail him once more. He can't see
      the color of the plant development. He can't see changes in color
      or make accurate observations of PH test strips or any test strip.
      Science with plants (botany) is nearly impossible with his  inaccuracy. please help us in raising awareness as well as help Andy continue
    his goals of soil science.",349,of $349 goal,https://fundrazr.com/01Gh8f,Help Andy see life in full color for his birthday!,2,,U.S. Dollar
"HI THERE! My boyfriend and I are a couple of
      grad students, who met almost a year ago on a dating app. Life has
      never been the same since, and that's just the way we like it! He has moderate-profound deuteranopia, meaning the cones in his
    eyes that perceive green light don't work as well as they should.
    This prevents him from seeing certain things, such as red flowers
    blooming in green trees, or that he bought a pink shirt and green
    pants instead of a white shirt and brown pants. What started as pondering what to get him for our first anniversary
    turned into the idea of doing a modified Five Senses gift. For those
    who haven't heard of this, usually you give the person five small
    gifts that appeal to each of the five senses, such as scented
    candles for Smell, or a new CD for Hearing. However, I thought it
    would be cool if instead, I could give him larger gifts, and allow
    him to choose which sense he wanted on five special occasions
    throughout the year. Enter Enchroma, the colorblindness-correcting glasses. I cannot
    think of a more perfect gift for the sense of Sight. He has brought
    so much joy and beauty into my life and those around us. Please help
    me return the favor by donating. Any amount helps. I would like to purchase the Receptor glasses, as
    they are reasonably-priced and will fit over his existing glasses.
    All proceeds under the goal of $375 will go to Fundrazr/WePay/PayPal
    fees, and the purchase of the glasses. Any proceeds over $375 will
    go to upgrading the Enchroma glasses with prescription lenses
    (~$150.) If donations somehow exceed $525, the remaining proceeds
    will go to help with the cost of the other Five Senses gifts
    (~$250.) Any donations exceeding this will be donated to other
    individuals who are in need of EnChroma glasses. Thank you for reading! WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

"Curtiss is a 44 years old male with Primary Progressive Multiple
  Sclerosis. This is the most severe of all forms of MS with a rapid
  downhill progression.  There is no treatment for this type of MS. Curtiss is not only a fighter of MS he is also known as a Husband,
  father and grandpa. He was diagnosed with MS April 2010 at the age of 37. At the
  time he was working at Honeywell, where he had been for 15 of his 17
  year career in U.A.469 Refrigeration. Within 3 months after his
  diagnosis, he had to retire on disability. He now misses out on
  everyday life events, such as being a grandpa. His grandson, Julian,
  is now 6 and Curtiss has not been able to attend karate practice, swim
  class or even grandparents day at school. His first symptoms were loss of dexterity in his hands and loss
  of coordination in his legs. From that point on he continued to
  digress with repeated hospital visits due to falling numerous times
  which caused multiple head injuries, nasal fractures and 3 long days
  spent in the ICU. By February 2011, Curtiss was in a wheel chair. By June of
  2013, he was no longer able to drive. He was fully dependent on his
  wife who had to quit her job and become his full time caregiver. He is
  unable to shower, get in and out of bed and perform normal day to
  day tasks without her help. He has had to remodel his bathroom and various parts of his
  home to make it handicap accessible at great expense to him.  Curtiss
  has had to upgrade his current wheelchair based on his every day
  needs. Since he is no longer able to stand on his own, he needs a
  wheelchair that will stand him up so that he can get in and out of bed
  and transfer to his shower seat. Most of the cost of the expensive new wheelchair will be paid
  by his insurance company but he needs money for his copay which may be
  as high as $10,000. He has difficulty to get into his vehicle. A van with a ramp
  for transport will make it easier to accommodate his needs In order to
  get a used van he needs around $55,000.  A newer van should allow him
  years of vehicle usage with minimum out of pocket repairs and
  expenses.  He is confined to his house now due to lack of transport.
  Curtiss now misses out on his weekly guys night at the local
  restaurant down the street. He can’t spend the quality time with his
  wife on date nights due to the struggle of not being able to move in
  and out of the vehicle. He is stuck in the house waiting for his
  grandson to run in excited to tell his grandpa about earning his next
  belt in karate or moving into the next level in swim class. His
  grandson tells him daily “when you get your chair grandpa we will go
  to the park”. This is where you come in. Please help
  Curtiss get his freedom back and donate to help fund mounting expenses
  for his wheelchair and a handicap van. The goal for his fund is $65,000.","2,630",of $65k goal,https://fundrazr.com/511SPd,Keep S'Mylen- Lets regain Curtiss' freedom,31,,U.S. Dollar

"Hello, my name is Sandra Stout and I want to share my husband,
      Travis Stout, story. Travis was diagnosed with a certain type of
      color blindness that he never knew he had. It was a shock to us
      because he went for years until adulthood to know he was color
      blind. When he was first diagnosed he was in denial. He did not
      believe the doctor until we began taking test and compare colors
      to see what one another saw and yet he still did not want to believe. I always used to tease him and tell him he was color blind
      because I would point things out to him and he would never see it.
      But I always thought that I was either not pointing in the right
      direction or giving incorrect directions. It never occurred to me
      that he was truly color blind. Now that we all know he seems to almost feel embarrassed of
      his color blindness even ashamed at times. This August we are not
      only celebrating our first year or marriage, but my brothers
      birthday whom has been missing almost a decade ago. Which is the
      main reason I chose to get married on a whim that day and my

"MY STORY Who Am I? That's a big question.  I will try to keep it simple.  I am a woman
  on a mission.  My mission: to attend graduate school at POCA Tech in
  Portland, OR. Why? I feel passionate about the mission of POCA Tech. ""...to provide acupuncture to underserved communities
    through the People’s Organization of Community Acupuncture (POCA)..."" ""...to train the next generation of community
    acupuncturists. Community Acupuncture is a social business model
    providing affordable & accessible acupuncture to whoever needs
    and wants it. Community acupuncture is about health care, but it is
    also about social justice & affordable access to health care."" I could not say it better than as expressed on the POCA Tech website
  as to what affordable care means to patients of community acupuncture: ""...the biggest impact of having low funds is that in
    every direction, it limits your options. Community Acupuncture is a
    treasure. It is a mighty weapon in my quest to maintain (and now
    IMPROVE) my health...Community Acupuncture will also PREVENT many
    future health complications."" ""...Life is often difficult. Sometimes bad things happen
    and your resources are limited. Community Acupuncture means that
    there is still hope, that life can improve, that one's days can at
    the least be more bearable."" ""...""affordable acupuncture can heal the
    world."" Freedom from pain and increased abilities allow me to
    be a better steward of my resources and to make a more positive
    impact on my world...Affordable acupuncture does not enable me, it
    empowers me. By gifting me with better health I can then go out and
    do my part to fix the ills around me. The outward ripples of healing
    from Community Acupuncture are exponential."" ""...Somewhere there is the idea that people with limited
    funds have used bad judgement to get to such a position...this
    viewpoint overlooks the reality that situations and people
    can...change. Life itself is valuable and should be cherished. The
    world would be very miserable indeed if there were no second
    chances. Every time I visit my Community Acupuncture clinic, I see
    and hear the punks being heroes to people in need. In my opinion
    this is true beauty."" What will the funds raised be used for? Because POCA Tech has a different model, traditional student loans
  are not available.  I am so sure in my heart that this is the way
  forward - for me, for acupuncture, for affordable health care, for
  social justice.  I will use the funds raised to pay my tuition.  I
  will work through school as hard and as much as I can to support the
  day to day of my life.  What I need most help with is tuition.  The
  total tuition for POCA Tech is $17,400.  I know, I am shooting for the
  moon.  I am trusting, I am believing, I am hoping for a miracle. From the POCA TECH Website: "" This is the Equation: the cost of becoming an acupuncturist (education, certification,
      licensing, and setting up a practice) should roughly = what an
      acupuncturist can expect to earn in their first 12-18 months of practice Everything about POCA Tech’s program is designed to make the
    Equation work. "" The cost of acupuncture programs ranges from $40k - $100K.  POCA Tech
  is completely intentional in their creation of an affordable
  acupuncture education to ensure the ability to graduate and to offer,
  through a model of social justice, affordable health care to all.
   Acupuncture for the people! I need help. I want to be a part of this revolution.  POCA Tech is shattering the
  paradigm and shifting the landscape of affordable health care. Thank you, thank you.  Thank you for just taking the time to read
  this.  Thank you for considering a donation towards this beautiful

"This time we would like to do something different. As most of you
  know and used it, we had a Baby Registry for Lina and we received
  wonderful items for her. We held on to everything and valued it,
  thinking we might get to use it again later. Well so it happens, we
  are setting up the nursery and even the overseas move was good to it
  all. So we would prefer to use the same items again. After doing some
  research we also found out that some things, including clothes are not
  being shipped to APO/military addresses for whatever reason which
  would also make it hard with a Baby Registry. So we decided to go a
  different route. Instead of a Baby Registry we would like you to be
  part of our Baby's Stem Cell Freezing. Whatever amount you would have
  spent on something on a registry just donate it here, preferably with
  a name so we can create a card and put down all names so he/she will
  know later who was part of it. Of course we are hoping that it will
  never come to the point that she/he is in need of the Stem Cells but
  it sure is a nice thought that if there is the need for it you all
  were part of saving her/his life. This plan covers freezing for 25
  years and after that he/she can decide to extend it or not. We have
  Lina's Stem Cells frozen and we are going to do so for this one but we
  as said we are thinking it would be a wonderful gift coming from
  everybody. And the reason why we are calling it Baby, he/she or this
  one is because our little creation is stubborn already and willing to
  answer the gender question. Always in the position like on the photo

"Hi everyone, My name is Paul De La Torre. I am from Philippines. I am 30 years
  old. I am the 4th child among 6 siblings. I am a Christian. My cause is to raise funds for my Dad's heart operation. My Dad
  is 67 years old, he is also a Christian in fact all in the family are
  Christian. When we were still little, my Dad reads to us a chapter or
  two of the bible every week. He molded us to become good citizens to
  fear God and be good to everyone around us. We are not wealthy, we get
  by our lives just enough for us to keep on living. Despite of that, we
  manage to pull through. Our salaries and wages from our jobs is just
  enough for us to keep ourselves fed and have a roof under our heads. My Dad is no longer working. My Dad is suffering from a heart
  ailment. His heart is enlarged and on August 2, 2017 - a day we did
  not expect to happen. I was sleeping in my room when my sister woke me
  up and told me that my Dad was feeling unwell and he is felt pain in
  his chest. I was worried on what my Dad was feeling. I asked him if he
  wanted to go to the hospital. He said, he only wants a check up since
  we know we do not have a big fund for us to be admitted to the
  hospital. But then as we went to the hospital, we decided to go
  directly to the emergency room because my other siblings suggested
  that it is better, just to make sure it doesn't get any worse. Upon arriving at the hospital, my dad was checked and went for an
  X-Ray, blood test, and ECG. It was later found out that the pain my
  Dad felt was a heart attack. Seeing your Dad, suffer, and the thought of possibly losing him is
  hard. My siblings and my mom, wants to save my Dad's life. We tried
  our best to ask, and borrow money from the people close to us, and the
  people we know who can lend us financial help. But as the days passed
  by, our medical bills keep piling up, and the doctors suggested to
  have him undergo Angioplasty operation since it was seen that 3
  arteries are blocked already. One artery was blocked 100% the other
  two was blocked 70%. My Dad is having difficulty breathing and the
  doctor said if this won't be addressed soon. It could be fatal. We
  managed to borrow some money for one artery (the 100% blocked) to
  undergo Angioplasty, but the money we borrowed is not enough for the
  other 2 blocked arteries to be operated upon. Me and my family are asking from your kind hearts to lend us a
  helping hand, as we try to give my Dad a second chance at life. He is
  a very good father. He is responsible. He has wonderful insights about
  life and living. He is a loving father. He takes good care of all of
  us. He is loved by many. I only wish he can survive this medical
  challenge he is facing now, indeed the doctors assured that he can
  survive after the operation is done. Please help us fund his
  operation. He needs to have 3 stents of angioplasty operation. We will
  be very grateful for whatever amount you can give us. It will surely
  help my Dad. My mom and silbings are struggling to raise funds
    to pay the ballooning hospital bills and for the future stage 2
    procedures. Our Lord will surely repay you as what Proverbs
  19:17 says "" Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord , and he will repay him for his deed."" No donation is too small and it will mean so much to my family. Thank you very much for your help and time. Please leave me a
  message whether it is for me or for my Dad. From the bottom of my
  heart and my family. Thank you very much for your help. We are
  eternally grateful for the financial assistance. God Bless you always.","1,897",of $17k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41GeR3,Please help us with the hospital bill of my Dad.,47,,U.S. Dollar

"Since the summer of 2013, my colleagues and I have been working and
  living among the Hadza hunter foragers of Tanzania. As the last hunter
  forager group in Tanzania - who literally still hunt the same animals
  and gather the same plants that our ancestors did for millions of
  years - the Hadza may hold in their guts some
    important clues to what a healthy or optimal gut microbiome might
    look like at different stages of life. By collecting stool samples from hundreds of Hadza as they shift
  between seasonal resources - and freezing them in liquid nitrogen in
  the field - we use next generation sequencing to map composition of
  microbes in the Hadza gut. With this information - along with detailed
  diet and lifestyle data - we can compare this ancestral microbiome to
  thousands of westerners in the American Gut Project - the
  largest open source and crowd funded science project in the world (a
  project I co-founded). Even though we've raised money for the Hadza project - and received
  mountains of free sequencing via our colleagues at the Earth Microbiome Project - we need more funds to
  continue our field work. What we've accomplished and learned so far and what else needs
    to be done: Accomplished and Learned Collected and sequenced ~1,500 fecal, skin, water, soil, animal
    and plant samples from ""Hadza Land"" over the course of two
    field sessions (2013-2015). This represents the largest number of
    samples ever sequenced for a rural or ancestral population anywhere
    in the world. Acquired and outfitted a 4x4 Land Cruiser for rough and rugged
    landscape of East Africa (and cobbled together tents, tables,
    chairs, satellite dish for internet, and so on for our base camp). Trained two Tanzanian field assistants - ongoing process. Put together a world-class team of researchers - who are mentioned
    in this 3-page feature about our project that appeared in the
    prestigious journal Science - from New
    York University, Stanford, UCSD, and researchers from the National
    Institute of Medical Research in Tanzania to collaborate on the analysis. Applied for and acquired all necassary permits and ethical
    clearances (IRB) for the study in Tanzania and the U.S. Not any easy
    task given the layers and layers of bureaucracy! Though we haven't published any of our data yet (coming 2016), we
    are excited that we have documented a seasonal shift in the Hadza
    gut microbiome between dry and wet season. This is critical as it
    goes to the heart of what an optimal or balanced gut microbiome
    might look - in other words, it may be a moving target if evolution
    is our guide. We also see differences between men and women,
    something we don't see in western societies. We also see much
    greater diversity of microbes on and in the Hadza when compared to
    us westerners. Mounting research suggests this diversity may be our
    ancestral state and protective! We also don't see a drop in the
    diversity as Hadza age - something that happens in western
    populations. We also see an extraordinary diversity of microbes in
    the Hadza environment as a result of our environmental sampling of
    plants, animals, soil, water and so on. This ""meta
    community"" of microbes is the source pool for Hadza microbes.
    We also see interesting patterns in the breastfed babies not seen in
    the western babies. And the list goes on! What Needs To Be Done - WE NEED YOUR HELP Based on our initial sampling and data, we will be submitting our
    results for peer-review publication in 2016. This is where
      you come in! We need funds for diesel, fuel, beans and rice,
      supplies, salaries for Tanzanian research assistants, and
      never-ending repairs to our aging field vehicle. Every nickel counts! Now that we have sampled a large number of Hadza across multiple
    seasons and bush camps, we are now focusing on following a much
    smaller group of Hadza for detailed longitidunal sampling (we are
    also very, very interested in detailed sampling of newborns,
    essentially sampling them from birth through introduction of first
    solids at 4-6 months). In addition, we want to expand our data set
    of environmental samples from plants and animals in Hadza land as
    this is critical to understanding where and how a
    ""free-living"" human population acquires microbes from the environment. If you would like to consider an ""off line"" donation

"What is my story? What am I fundraising for? Hi, my name is Fozzy Craig Lai, and I need a scooter. Insurance will not cover a scooter that fits in my car, which is key
  to my unrestricted participation in my community! I was diagnosed with
  Fibromyalgia in 2014, though I felt the impact and dealt with the
  symptoms for some time before that. At this point, I am not able to
  walk more than one city block without severe pain nor can I ride a
  bike, because I have too much pain in my hands and legs. This means
  that I need to use my car to travel everywhere, and can only go to
  places where I can park close by and not have to walk around inside. I am restricted in where I can go with my kid, who is 10 years old- I
  want to be able to take her out to the Science Centre, and the Museum,
  and all the places a child wants to go. But this is difficult and
  sometimes impossible because I need to rent a wheelchair at these
  places AND have someone else to push me, I cannot expect my partner to
  shoulder this responsibility because he is most often at work and he
  has taken on other extra responsibilities due to my chronic pain. A
  scooter will make these trips possible for us! Having a scooter will help my anxiety because I will be able to go
  out into the community rather than being stuck at home. As well, I
  won't have to worry about whether I will be able to find a place to
  sit, or if there will be a wheelchair that I can use there. It will
  also be a huge benefit to my kid, who is looking forward to being able
  to go out and have adventures with me! Imagine being a kid whose
  parent cannot take them out- it is really disappointing for her. How much do I need, and what will it be used for? I need a total of $5000, and that will be used to buy both the
  scooter, as well as the lift that will allow me to put it in my car
  for travel. This also accounts for the extra service charges for
  taking credit cards on the platform. Please considering donating to my scooter fund- you'll be improving
  not just my life, but the life of my family! I also appreciate this
  being shared across social media- the more people who see this, the better!","1,465",of $4.3k goal,https://fundrazr.com/21Fllc,Fozzy Needs A Scooter!,19,,Canadian Dollar

"About Me My name's Adam and I live in Cardiff, the capital city of Wales, in
  the United Kingdom. I'm 15 years old and it's my birthday today. I've
  been looking at these glasses for some time now, but have never had
  the money to afford a pair. I go to school and am undergoing my GCSE exams. My Experiences I'd almost completely forgotten about these glasses until I was
  sitting one of my Science exams - Biology I think. I had memorised all
  the colour changes of the reactions before the exam so that I would be
  equipped for the exam in all its capacity. Unfortunately, I turned one
  of the pages and the next question relied solely on seeing the colour
  of the reactions on the page - something that I was unable to do.
  Don't worry - I managed to answer the question fine because of what I
  had remembered in preparation. But it was harder for me than it had to
  be - all because of my unfortunate affliction. This is only the most recent event where not seeing colours has
  affected me - but I can assure you there are hundreds, if not
  thousands of other examples like this in my day to day life (if not
  less extreme). Colour blindness And My Life For all of my life, I have experienced unfortunate circumstances with
  colours, like the one mentioned above. Ever since I was a little boy
  (about four years old), I've known about this thing that I was taught
  I had to live with. At about the age of 13, I saw a video that my friend showed me of
  someone's reaction to having these glasses and to see the colour
  purple for the very first time. Ever since that day, I've been fixated
  by these magical glasses, with some very complex and, let's not lie,
  not entirely understandable engineering. But only one thing matters -
  they work. My Family And Colour blindness My Grandad had to go his whole life without seeing colours. My Mum,
  being a woman, didn't have to experience this, and neither has my
  brother; but I, drawing the short straw, have to deal with colour
  blindness in my everyday life and in situations where life would be a
  whole lot easier if I could just see that thing that I need to see. Why I Need Your Help Being a student (and a young one at that), my income is currently
  nil. Though I currently volunteer, helping with children, I earn no
  money through doing so. I have, however, managed to save up some money
  from doing chores and from birthdays and Christmases, but nowhere near
  enough to buy EnChroma glasses - especially with the added shipping
  and handling fees of getting delivered to the UK. My family can't really help either. I wouldn't call us poor - not by
  any means. But we earn what we need, and we don't have that excess
  amount of money needed to spend on glasses that I can, unfortunately,
  do without. What You Can Do I need your help to do this - without it, I could go my whole life
  without seeing colours properly. If you can donate anything - from $1
  to $100 - I'm grateful to everybody who decides to donate to me and
  decides to help me see the world how it should be seen. If you don't have the money to donate or if you've already donated,
  you can still help! Share my campaign with your friends, family, loved
  ones, or just any old person you bump in to and I will be so grateful.
  If any of them can donate, then you will have done me a favour by
  referring them. Your Donations If any of you are kind enough to donate to me, your money will go
  towards the glasses - a means for me to see the world as it should be
  seen, as it's meant to be seen. I need $349 for the Gilman glasses,
  and possibly a bit more to handle the shipping (depending on how much
  it comes to). Finishing Thoughts I don't really know what to say, or how to finish this. So I'll just
  say thank you. Thank you to everyone who donates, thank you to
  everyone who tells their friends, and thank you - thank you for caring.",130,of £350 goal,https://fundrazr.com/f1Ge18,Help me see a rainbow for my birthday.,10,,Pound Sterling

  what colors he had in his hand before using it. This trick was taught
  to him by his Papa (my father, who is also color blind) My father, Brian, decided to buy his

"Hi There! We’re a family of four that are in great need of support to help
    our youngest member Justin, recover from Lyme’s Disease, as well as
    rehab off of addictive Schizophrenic medication. In short, he was bitten by a deer tick on an eco-estate, which
    had imported deer from Germany, and he came down with all the
    symptoms of Lyme’s Disease. In South Africa where we stay, there are
    no facilities to test for Lyme’s Disease and doctors automatically
    rule that out as a diagnosis, because it’s widely believed that one
    can’t contract it here. Instead, they misdiagnosed Justin with
    Schizophrenia and placed him on a treatment that seems to have
    caused even more neurological damage in the years to follow. One of the main problems that Justin has is severe insomnia,
    which seems to have gotten way worse since he’s been on the
    anti-psychotic medication. Some of the latest research on insomnia
    suggests that the brain begins to “eat itself” after extended
    periods of sleep deprivation, which we can relate to – sometimes
    Justin is no different to someone with Alzheimer’s Disease or
    Dementia. When Justin sleeps however, the majority of his symptoms
    rapidly improves and we strongly believe with your help that we can
    find a way to reverse his condition! The Plan While spending many hours looking for ways to solve this
    problem, mom found a perfect neurologist in the US who seems to be
    an expert in dealing with cases like Justin’s. Dr Klinghardt
      is an expert in neurology and devising holistic treatment
    protocols to help his patients heal. We believe that this doctor
    will be able to accurately diagnose and treat Justin. In addition,
    we also have found various medical centers that test genetics
    (unlike in South Africa) so that we may get an exact understanding
    of Justin’s condition. We need funds to fly to the US to receive proper diagnosis and
  treatment . We need a total of $50K to cover our basic costs
  (it may cost more depending on what the doctor says). We will need to
  stay overseas for up to six months and this funding will cover
  airfares, modest accommodation, diagnostic tests and Justin’s
  treatment for six months. We believe that Dr Klinghardt, in combination with genetic profiling
  will get to the root of the problem. You can find out more info about
  him here: http://drklinghardt.com/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKx_TMPQJsY The Full Story Every day that passes we watch Justin slip further away both
    physically and mentally … Some days are better than others … He
    suffers so much in his confused exhaustion that it’s hard to witness
    and difficult to live with. We honestly don’t know how he manages to
    continue, and so bravely, when his nightmare never seems to end. Justin’s problems began after he was misdiagnosed with
      Schizophrenia almost 4 years ago following a tick bite. The eco-estate we lived on at that time, had a private game
    reserve that included imported deer from Europe, amongst a variety
    of other game. Justin contracted his bite whilst being taken for a
    walk by our two huskies in the game park. He lost his balance and
    was dragged along for a short way. Two days later, mom spotted a
    tick on his leg and removed it. She noticed that it was unlike any
    of the species we normally see in South Africa. After searching for
    ticks on google images, we saw that it was identical to ticks that
    are found on deer in Europe and in the US; and that they are the
    ones that give people a disease called Lyme’s disease. In
      South Africa, there is no test for Lyme’s Disease, since
    it is widely believed that we don’t have ticks that transmit this
    disease in our country. In the year before, our dad died suddenly when he was
      hit by a car as he was crossing a street. We had no
    choice but to use the local government hospital to treat Justin’s
    condition, as we couldn’t afford private health care. The hospital
    staff dismissed our fears of Lyme’s disease from the start, and
    because he had been depressed and suffered from insomnia after dad’s
    death, they concluded that Justin had Schizophrenia. Initially, the
    anti-psychotic meds and benzodiazepines showed a modest improvement,
    but Justin became severely sleep deprived and was unable to sleep
    deeply or experience life normally. After a few months, a family friend donated funds so that we
    could treat Justin privately. He was taken off the hospital
    medications and slowly started to recover with a natural holistic
    program. He made steady progress in this
    time. Although he was not the same person as before, he was
    at least able to play the piano again and integrate back into being
    a part of the family. During this time, mom stopped working and his
    older brother moved back home to help us (sister and mom) care for
    him, as well as put food on the table. The medical expenses were
    exorbitant and after a year we could no longer continue with private treatment. By the end of 2015, two years after Justin’s initial tick bite, he was bitten a second time , but this time it was
    by one of our local ticks. It's usually fairly easy to recover from
    an acute bout of tick bite fever from these ticks, but in Justin’s
    case the whole nightmare we thought was behind us began all over
    again … We had to rush him intohospital and this
    time he was put on even stronger anti-psychotic medication. The
    doctors we saw (a different one every time) believed that he had
    relapsed because we had taken him off the previous prescription
    of anti-psychotic meds. In spite of the latest medication, Justin has not recovered
    since and in the last 18 months he has deteriorated rapidly. He has
    lost over 24 kilograms in the last 7 months. He sleeps a few hours
    every 4 -5 nights. He has dream states and rapid eye movements in
    mid sentence and his memory is not functional. He has become very
    childlike and needs constant supervision and input. Since
      being on the benzodiazepine medicine, he has also developed
      obsessive behaviors , like having the same conversations
    over and over, bingeing on food or pacing in continuous loops
    through the house. He is very stressed and unable to relate to
    people or even our animals, although he adored them before and used
    to spend the most time with them. The medications have not worked and we believe that they are
      making his condition worse - he has become a hollow shell of his former beautiful self.
    The hospital’s staff says that there is nothing we can do; except
    put him on even stronger medications and put him into a government
    institution. The place they recommend has a ghastly reputation and
    is like a prison for the insane - it's like giving him a living
    death sentence. Our family feels that this is outrageous – it is not
    a solution and we cannot agree to just give up on Justin, especially
    after we have already seen him nearly recovered the first time!
    Justin needs expert help that is not available in our
    under-resourced public health system. After reviewing all the
    research we could find, we believe that we need to take him
      overseas to the US to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",105,of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41GoD5,Justin's Journey,3,,U.S. Dollar
"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.","1,442",of $500k goal,https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1,Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,20,,U.S. Dollar

    help me give my son the gift he hasn't had his entire life - color

"My name's Ariel. I'm a survivor of childhood
      domestic abuse, and was sexually assaulted in high school and
      multiple times in college. In the past year, I've been
      diagnosed with PTSD. Needless to say, I have my issues. But this isn't about me. This is about Kevin, and why he
      should get a pair of EnChroma glasses. Kevin and his wife, who I met
      through their son (my boyfriend), met me and pretty much instantly
      took me in. In the past two years, long story short, the joke's
      become that I get to keep them in the divorce. They've been my advisors when I've
      had few others to turn to. They've opened their home to me, given
      me a place to feel safe when my brain gets twitchy and starts
      viewing the world around me as a threat, shared holidays and
      birthdays and basically been a slightly more sane version of the
      Callahans to my Sandra Bullock in While You Were Sleeping (without the coma and confusion of brothers). They've given me a home. Kevin is red-green color blind.
      Shortly after I met him he showed me an app that gave me a look
      through his eyes into what he termed his ""sad little
      world"". Kevin is also a massive, massive
      geek. Imagine watching Star Wars and not being able to tell the
      difference between the lightsabers, not having a complete idea of
      what a redshirt looks like, or going to Comic Con and not seeing
      the brilliant colors that follows cosplayers everywhere they go. I'd heard of EnChroma before--just,
      never been in a place to try and afford it, but instantly I wanted
      to try and brighten his world with all the color the majority of
      the population gets to see every day. I figure it's time to stop putting it off. I just still need
      a little help. Please, help me get these glasses
      for him. Help him literally see what he's
      helped me to see. Help me, in some small way, repay him. Kevin wears prescription glasses, so, the $499 is the goal. PS: If you know him, keep it secret! I'm hoping to get this
      to him for Christmas. WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color

"Hi my name is Erickson Ortiz, I’m a Graphic Designer and Web
    Developer and I am colorblind. I didn’t realize I had a red/green
    deficiency until 2 years ago and I thought it wasn’t the big deal,
    I’ve been colorblind all my life but It’s been really hard because
    of my job and my passion that is to paint/draw portraits. Since I was a kid I had to rely on color pencils with name printed
    names printed on them so I could tell the difference between each
    color, nowadays Photoshop is my main tool I use everyday at work.
    Sadly, all my life I thought I was seeing the same colors anyone can see. I thought I could see like any normal person, but after knowing
    that I am colorblind, confusion is a feeling that I have everyday. I
    have been struggling all this time trying to tell the difference
    between colors and I was so excited when a friend showed me the
    Enchroma video ad, but a Graphic Designer here in Orlando is a
    career that does not pay much honestly. Prescription Enchroma glasses are US$499 plus
      taxes, and if you could help me spread this message so I can
      hopefully see all the colors you can see I will be forever
      grateful! I can also draw a portrait of anyone who can help me
    raise enough so I don’t have to pay the full price for the glasses

"Duane R. Jones 55, until recently, had been a hard working man all
  his life in the Corpus Christi, Texas area. Many in his community know
  him from Mars Vacuum, where he worked for 20 plus years. And was also
  known for being very generous with his homegrown vegetables and
  homemade pickles. Duane was hospitalized with Pneumonia. While being treated for that,
  he developed another case of it. He was diagnosed with pulmonary
  fibrosis and major scarring of the lungs during his recent  2 month
  hospital stay and is in need of a lung transplant. Fortunately, Mr. Jones has insurance to help cover some of these
  medical expenses, but as he learns to adjust to his new life hooked up
  to Oxygen, he is unable to re join the workforce anytime in the near future. Besides the usual household expenses and now co-pays, his HVAC unit
  is in dire need of replacement.  Temporary fixes have helped, but he
  really needs a new unit. Being on oxygen and struggling to breathe,
   Should he go in for surgery, worrying about whether he will have air
  conditioning or heat should be the least of his concerns. Funds raised from this campaign will go towards that major expense,
  and help out with other bills and other unforseen expenses. Duane has always been a very kind and giving person and with limited
  funds, is in need of help during this difficult time.  His goal is to
  return to being a productive part of society and be able to resume
  vegetable gardening (which he loves) Thank you for your help, and if you aren't able to help at this time,

        father who loved, gave and installed traits and manners in me
        that I wouldn't trade for anything. He also has two wonderful
        sons, one being an artist.  My father has a keen eye for art but
        has never seen the true colors of my brother artistic
        accomplishments or any of the other pieces of art work he owns. My goal in getting these
        glasses for my Dad is so he can see and be in awe of all of the
        incredible spectrum of color that this world holds. He is in the golf
          business.  Can you imagine never really being able to see the
          true greens of a golf course? Also he needs assistance
          to put outfits together due to his color blindness,,,all my
          life I have been assisting him with what goes with what, along
          with my wonderful stepmom! I have researched these
          glasses and can you believe some people never knew what the
          color purple was before putting these glasses on? So my goal is for my dad
          to see all of the incredible spectrums of color that this
          world has.  He's 71, he's waited long enough! Please help me with this
          awesome mission of mine to give something to my Dad that he's
          never experienced or had before.  It's honestly all I want to
          give him and to see the look on his face when he puts the
          glasses on and can see colors for the first time in his life! Any amount donated above
          the cost of the glasses will go directly to another person
          looking to help a loved one to see color for the first time! This is an honest effort
          for my father who has given so much to me.  He's selfless,
          giving, compassionate, funny, loving and the best dad anyone
          could ever have!  Please help him to see the colors that we

      were planning our wedding I was asking him his opinion on

      ""choose whatever colors you want it dosent matter to me
      anyway"". My heart stopped, I realized he will never see how
      beautiful our reception was, how pretty his sister's looked
      standing up there with us. As time went on and our children were
      born I couldn't help but think he will not be able to see the
      details in their first drawings, help them as they learned their
      colors without having to read the color written on the side of the
      crayon first. I cannot imagine how that feels to not be able to
      teach such an easy thing. And then let's be honest who hasent
      played a board game with him where he has not had to do a color
      roll call for to confirm what colors are part of the game before
      we can start. I would just love to be able to give him a little

      enhance the lives and reduce the suffering of the most vulnerable

      off-line. The first helped get us started by funding travel,
      accommodation, security and expenses for our photographer, Scott
      Doubt, and I, this May . The 2nd is still paying for costs
      to produce and distribute content from that trip - stories, video
      interivews, photographic essays, articles, and for developing
      social media and web channels to grow awareness and encourage
      engagement. We also are so fortunate to have many professional
      volunteers who have contributed invaluable expertise to the project. Y ou can follow fresh stories and reports as
      they are produced on Facebook and Youtube . Our goal of $5,000.00 for this campaign is higher

      including a volunteer videographer (along with a photographer) on

      grows and produces more outcomes.  By investing your support from
      the beginning, you will be contributing to the sustainability of
      this continuous multi-media documentation. Life is hard in Haiti, even with incremental progress
  since the earthquake of 2010. Yet, Haitians are the most wonderful,

"Our names are Leslie Hoddevik and Macey Gándara. We are the PE
  teachers at Chehalem Elementary and we have way too much fun teaching
  our 500 wonderful students together. We often have ideas that involve using a projector screen. Due to the
  nature of our gym and stage situation, we are unable to use a
  projector set-up because the chords would be a tripping hazard to
  students. We also would like to use a projector during the morning
  times to get the kids moving several days a week before classes begin. Therefore a rear facing projector screen with an Apple TV hooked up
  to the projector would be an amazing addition to our Physical
  Education program as well as a helpful tool for the whole school to
  use every day.  We would have a projector set-up behind the rear
  screen on the stage so no chords would be on the gym floor. We have
  access to iPads that we would airplay through the Apple TV onto the

"נמאס שהמדינה מצאה לנכון למרוח זמן ולבחור מה ""כדאי לה
    לקדם"" ומה לא. מדובר בתקציבים שיועדו בדיוק למטרה הזו אך שנים
    רבות הולכות לכיוונים אחרים (סיוע התישבויות, העלאת שכרם של החכים ועוד
    מיני מטרות מוזרות) - כל אחד יכול להפוך בין לילה לנכה - כתוצאה
    מתאונה, כתוצאה ממחלה כרונית ועוד אין ספור דוגמאות) אך מה קורה למי
    שנופל לסבך הזה? האם עליו לקבל את גזירת הגורל שהמדינה הנוכחית בראשות
    ביבי והליכוד קובעת עבורו ועבור עוד 800 אלף נכים ו120 אלף קשישים??
    כאשר הסברתי לשרים, מפלגות וקבוצות בפייסבוק שאנשים מתים מרעב כנראה שלא מבינים  את ההיקף או את החומרה בדבריי.... ישראל 2017 -אנשים
    בעלי מוגבלות נאבקים כדי לשרוד! ואם יש משפחה או חברים - זו לא אחריותם
    לטפל ולרוב - נכים מקבלים יחס מפלה גם ממשפחתם - לעד לבד... השאלה היא
    לא האם ישנם תקציבים או לא - ידוע כבר שכאשר רוצים משיגים בקלות...
    השאלה היא מי מהממשלה הנוכחית נרתם באמת למאבק - תשובה קצרה לי -אף
    אחד! אם היו חוששים מערב הבחירות הייתם רואים שינויי עוד אתמול, אך
    מאחר וכחלון וביבי יודעים שאין מה ""למהר"" הם ייקחו את הזמן
    ואולי יעלו לקראת סוף הקנדציה בעוד שנתיים. אנשים מתים מרעב - מה לא
    מובן??!!!! לכן פתחתי במאבק הזה - אני יודע היטב מה זה ללכת לישון רעב
    במשך חודשים, מה זה שהמשפחה והסביבה לא סופרת אותך ממטר \ לא מתעניינת
    כלל בקשיים שיש לאדם נכה, ואין ממי לבקש עזרה.. אז החלטתי לנסות
    ולהתחיל מאבק רציני - אך מאבקים פירושם הוצאות הרבה מעבר למה שיש לי -
    ואני באמת מבטיח לכם - אינני מנסה להתעשר על חשבונכם, אני לא ""אקח
    את הכסף ואברח"" אני רק מנסה לקדם מאבק של כל אלו שיושבים בבית
    וקולם נדם. את כל אלו שאין להם סיכוי בישראל 2017   להגיע ליום בו

"URGENT: My name is Lana Sinclair, I thank you for taking time to read
  this. My son Richard had a spinal fusion and found out he is allergic
  to the metal hardware holding his spine together. He is suffering
  tremendously from a metal MONSTER INSIDE his spine that triggered auto
  immune disease and unbearable pain. I humbly ask for your support and
  need donations for expenses to go to Los Angeles, California to get
  urgent specialized medical treatment and surgery to remove the toxic metal. His story is lengthy, but I felt it was very important to share
  information and raise awareness in medical community and public
  about metal implant allergy, a MONSTER INSIDE. RICHARD'S STORY: In September 2011 Richard was injured in a car accident. The auto
  insurance company was not cooperative and refused to authorize payment
  for treatment.  His only option was county health plan and he had to
  see the doctor they assigned. It did not cover any treatment he
  needed. His condition rapidly deteriorated. After being in pain and
  asking for months he finally had an MRI. The results showed spine
  abnormalities and he was referred to an orthopedic surgeon for a
  lumbar spine microdiskectomy in March 2013. The county health
  insurance would not cover physical therapy. I lost my job for needing
  to take time off to assist my son, and had to move immediately. I had
  bought Richard a classic car for his 16th birthday, he had it for 12
  years. Richard loved that car but sold it to help pay to move to a
  place that would allow our beloved pets ... to this day I am sick at
  heart he had to. In September of 2013, 6 months after surgery, the insurance finally
  approved physical therapy. The very first day of pool therapy, the
  disc previously operated on herniated. I was at work, Richard barely
  made it home and called me and said something was wrong, he couldn't
  walk. I rushed home and called an ambulance. The ER staff said they
  didn't know what was wrong, the MRI looked ok and kept him overnight
  for observation. I went home to check the pets and get some sleep. My
  son called me the next morning, said they discharged him saying it was
  a pulled muscle. He told me he kept begging them to listen, he was in
  agony and they made him get up when he could barely walk. He was in a wheelchair waiting outside the hospital when I arrived to
   pick him up. I didn't know what to do or think. I barely got him in
  the van to to go home. It took 1/2 hour to go from the van into the
  house and help him lay on the bed. He could not get up and was
  screaming in pain. I called ambulance again and demanded they take him
  to a different hospital. We told the ER doctor what happened, he
  checked the medical system and came back and told us the other
  hospital read the wrong MRI, the lumbar disc was badly herniated. They
  did not have the facilities to do anything, he had no choice but to
  send my son back to the first hospital by ambulance to have surgery. The previous surgeon was called in to see Richard and told him he had
  to have lumbar spinal fusion, with metal rods and screws to stabilize
  the lower spine. He operated the next day and Richard was discharged
  in 23 hours because insurance wouldn't pay for longer stay. Almost
  immediately Richard complained of a different kind of pain and there
  was a strange discharge from the incision. After returning home the following day,
  Richard's entire lower back was swollen and severely
  bruised. I freaked out when I saw how bad it was and called the
  surgeon's office.  I described the swelling, bruising and heavy
  discharge, I had to change dressing frequently. I wanted to take him
  to the doctor but Richard wasn't supposed to ride in a car that soon
  after surgery.  The nurse said it was nothing to worry about. I was
  persistent and took my son to the surgeon's office and demanded they
  do something, his back was horrific looking. The surgeon had a shocked
  look on his face when he saw how bad it was and extracted several
  viles of ""fluid"" from his back. They gave him antibiotics
  and sent him home. The incision finally healed but Richard did not
  feel good and he complained about a ""different"" kind of
  pain. The doctor said it was going to take time before it got better!
  He was told to follow up with family doctor after that, due to
  insurance they would not be able to see him. We got notice to vacate because our rental was sold. We had to move 2
  weeks after Richard's 2nd surgery October 2013. By the grace of God we
  found a landlord with a soft heart willing to work with us and allow
  pets and our neighbors helped us move. The last 4 years since the spinal fusion have been a living hell for
  Richard. After the 2nd surgery Richard began experiencing bizarre
  immune reactions and digestive problems. Not only has he suffered
  physically, but the relentless pain has taken a toll on him. He went
  from being healthy, active and happy to being held captive of the
  pain, going to from the bed, the chair, the couch, constantly changing
  positions, unable to sleep well or relieve the constant gnawing
  burning stabbing pain. Richard always loved being around a lot of
  people, and he has been isolated by his illness. His cat Bud is his
  constant companion and best friend. My son went to the ER for unexplained swelling and acute pain flare
  ups. My son's concerns and symptoms were ignored and he was referred
  to pain counseling...because they did not see anything they assumed it
  was ""all in his head"". Richard waited months for
  appointments, I have taken him to every major medical facility in
  Michigan in search of help and relief. Nothing offered helped.  One
  painful and frustrating dead end after another, paying out of pocket
  for expenses, travel and treatment. My son continued to suffer because
  (1) doctor wouldn't accept insurance, (2) denied coverage for doctor
  ordered treatment or (3) did not cover much if any (4) would not
  listen/test/investigate symptoms. Despite exhausting every possible option we could think of nothing
  helped,  Richard's symptoms got worse and worse.  My son was told he
  had failed fusion syndrome and some people have a lot of pain
  afterward and he would have to learn how to cope with it.  One doctor
  said they were going to ""rip out the old hardware and put new
  fusion hardware in the rest of his spine"". Others said everything
  looked good go to pain counseling, it's all in your head. It was
  dehumanizing, frustrating and terrifying because every opinion my son
  got was something totally different. Who was right? Were they all wrong? My dear daughter had done her best to help her brother Richard
  throughout the ordeal. She too became ill during this time and had to
  have surgery. She had genetic testing for tendency for certain
  illnesses, she shared an article about it. I wanted to help and
  understand what she was dealing with and began to read medical
  research articles, and one day by chance, I tripped across an article
  on metal allergy. MONSTER INSIDE: The article was about a ""MELISA test"". A
  very comprehensive blood test that can detect if a person has metal
  sensitivity to a wide spectrum of surgical and dental implant metals.
  I then searched and found case studies written by doctors on patients
  who had a wide variety of bizarre auto-immune response symptoms
  including uncontrollable pain caused by metal implant devices. It was
  as if I was reading a story about my son. I also learned that metal
  surgical devices used have the potential for allergic reaction and
  patients should be tested PRIOR to surgery. Not one of the medical
  facilities I had taken my son to had ever investigated a possible
  allergy to the metal implant hardware. The side effects from prolonged
  exposure to metal toxicity are VERY VERY serious. Richard went to a special clinic to be tested, the results came
  back.. he tested POSITIVE for Titanium allergy. Most surgical metals
  and alloy components break down and corrode over time when exposed to
  body fluid and tissue, emitting particles into the body and triggering
  immune response. I was appalled to learn that Richard had not been
  tested prior to surgery, even though I later learned the implant
  manufacturer WARNED that patients should be tested and the device
  should be removed as soon as the bone had fused (healed). My son had
  it in his body for almost 4 years!!! The thought of what would have
  happened if that one doctor had fused the rest of his spine with the
  same metal made me nauseous. It was surreal to find out what had been causing the horrific pain
  and symptoms but it quickly changed to ""Oh my God, what can be
  done now? Who can help my son?"" When it comes to the Spine, there
  is absolutely no room for a mistake if my son was going to have a
  chance. I contacted previous medical providers with no success. I
  began calling all over the state and country looking for surgeons.
  Finding anyone with expertise that would work with the insurance
  situation has been a long dragged out nightmare,  Many of the doctors
  offices had never heard of metal allergy,  some did not believe us,
  some would not take complicated cases. I am scared if the wrong
  surgeon operated it could do irreversible damage and permanently
  cripple my son. I contacted the top hospitals across the country and asked for help.
  Expert spine reconstruction surgeons affiliated with top hospital
  in Los Angeles, CA can help my son. It will take an expert surgeon to
  remove the hardware, access any damage to surrounding tissue from
  prolonged exposure to toxic metal and determine if it may require a
  second non-metal spine stabilization surgery. There is a team of other
  doctors available to help with immune and other metal toxicity related issues. My son's health and future is at stake. This is a nightmare, I need
  your help. The financial strain has been increasingly difficult.  I
  was fired twice because I had to take time off, we were forced to move
  twice, the out of pocket expense for medicine, treatments, travel and
  doctor visits has been astronomical. I became self employed to be able
  to work from home but will have no income to maintain my home in
  Michigan for 3 months plus the cost to stay in California is so very
  expensive. I gratefully and humbly appreciate donations to help with
   lodging, adjustable bed, transportation, meals and non-covered
  medical. My best conservative estimate it could easily exceed $25,000. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Please Share. *METAL ALLERGY INFO: The symptoms are often overlooked. I know there
  are other people out there that are sick and in pain, suffering
  auto-immune disease and they don't know it could be caused by a metal
  implant, dental work or other surgical device. Go to MELISA.org for
  info. I hope sharing this story will spread awareness in the medical
  community and public. Please share with your loved ones, ask for a
  metal sensitivity / allergy test before any dental or surgical implant.","6,985",of $25k goal,https://fundrazr.com/b1HI85,MONSTER INSIDE- Spine Fusion Metal Implant Allergy,13,,U.S. Dollar

  their first child, a son Stephen, in 2007. After he was born, the
  Heines observed Stephen had broad thumbs and toes, which they found
  odd but endearing. He also had a LOT of hair! From birth, Stephen
  struggled with feeding which caused him to have trouble gaining
  weight. It was frustrating, but they chalked it up to reflux and enjoy
  their sweet new baby. As he grew, Stephen hit his milestones on time, but always at the
  late end of the ""normal"" range. When Stephen was nine months
  old, he had hernia surgery, which led to the discovery of a heart
  murmur and a kidney abnormality. Following surgery, Stephen's physical
  development stalled, and at one year old, he was referred for Early
  Intervention for therapies. There were still lingering
    questions about his health issues, and after additional testing,
    Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in
    May of 2008. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome , a
  genetic disorder which affects approximately 1:250,000 births, is
  characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual
  disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first
  toes. Additional features of the disorder can include eye
  abnormalities, heart and kidney defects, dental problems, and obesity.
  These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals. People with
  this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and
  cancerous tumors, including certain kinds of brain tumors. Cancer of
  blood-forming tissue (leukemia) also occurs more frequently in people
  with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Infants born with this severe form of
  the disorder usually survive only into early childhood. Thankfully Stephen’s overall health has balanced out, and he
    is a happy and thriving 4th grader. Currently, Stephen receives private physical and occupational
  therapies, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy in
  his school setting.  To meet his goals of independence as an adult,
  Stephen spends approximately 3/4 of his school day with his typically
  developing peers, in the regular education classroom. Also, he has
  difficulty communicating verbally, so he uses Proloquo2Go software on an iPad
  mini to communicate. Doctors have not given the Heines a timeline as to what they should
  expect with Stephen, so they take everything one day at a time.
  They're determined to not let their child's disability or illness keep
  them from doing the things they love and find a way to adapt and make
  that activity possible. Erik is an avid runner, and for years it has
  been an activity he can share with Stephen. Up until recently, they
  have been able to use a traditional running stroller which Stephen has
  now out grown and is not 100% safe for him. After much research, Eric
  found the Blade at www.hoytrunningchairs.com . Hoyt Running Chairs designs and
    manufactures state-of-the-art racing chairs for individuals with
    disabilities. As a subdivision of Southbridge Tool &
    Manufacturing , they are able to custom build each chair to the
    comfort and needs of both the rider and the runner. They pride
    themselves on getting to know their clients and providing them with
    the ultimate racing experience. Mike Didonato , the president of Southbridge
    Tool & Manufacturing first heard the story of Rick and Dick Hoyt in 2009. Dick Hoyt has pushed his son Rick,
      who was diagnosed a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy after
      his birth in 1962, in over 1,000 races including marathons,
      triathlons, and 6 Ironman races. Their story inspired Mike,
    and a few months later he happened to meet Dick Hoyt at a local
    grocery store. Mike mentioned his family’s manufacturing company and
    offered to fix Rick’s chair if needed. The next year, Dick Hoyt
    showed up at Southbridge Tool and Manufacturing and asked if a brand
    new chair could be built for Rick because he was very uncomfortable
    in his original chair. The Signature was built in time for the Hoyts to compete in the 2010 Boston Marathon . The chair was
    beautifully built for comfort, speed, and maneuverability. Soon,
    other teams and families began asking for a chair. In 2014, Mike was
    approached by Nick Sotar , a retired bicycle shop owner, who
    admired The Signature but had some ideas to improve the design. Nick
    presented Mike with a design for a revolutionary new racing chair
    called The Blade , which is easily
    disassembled and can be shipped in a bike box. After Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome at 18
  months old, it took almost seven years before they were able to get
  him on non-income-based Medicaid. As a result, the Heines ate through
  their entire family savings paying for medical bills and therapies
  even with insurance. Unfortunately, the cost of a Blade racing
    wheelchair is approximately 10% of Erik’s gross annual
  salary as a Professor of Music at Oklahoma City University ,
  and not something they have sitting around or in a savings account.
  The Blade has not been deemed ""essential"" by their
  insurance. However, Stephen's Occupational and Physical Therapists
  both believe that a chair that he can use for over a decade IS
  essential to helping him relieve stress and participate in an outdoor
  activity like his typically-developing peers. Ride to Give agrees and wants to provide Stephen with a custom
    built Blade that will fit him perfectly and will be used for years
    to come. Our mission at RTG is to turn athletic ability into
  fundraising power for families with children who are disabled,
  injured, or ill.  We think Stephen and Erik will make fantastic
  ambassadors for Team Ride to Give and we can’t wait to see them race
  for the first time with their new Hoyt Running Chair . Please help us purchase the
  Blade running chair and accessories for Stephen by making a tax
  deductible donation to Ride to Give. At this time, Stephen does not have a Facebook Page of his
    own, so follow Ride to GIve on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the
      donee organization (Ride to Give, 501c3 tax ID 46-2952297) has complete discretion and control over the use of all donated funds.

"WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color accuracy. Ron is one of the most beautiful souls you will ever meet. He is an
  Air Force Veteran, a cancer survivor, and a lover of life. When Ron
  was told that he was in full remission, after a long, difficult, 8
  year battle, it was like the doctor handed back his excitement and
  appreciation of absolutely everything. He never passes an opportunity
  to live and take in the moments that this world has to offer. He has
  always told me that he wished he could see color as most people do.
  His greens and reds all look like browns. He has no vibrancy to
  yellows, oranges, or pinks. I want to give him an opportunity to try
  these glasses in the hopes that he can expierience the vibrancy and
  beauty of life, as I know it to be. When I look at Ron, I see the
  worlds most beautiful colors. The brightest yellow that shines warmer
  than the sun, the most beautiful blue that brings comfort to so many,
  and the deepest red that could define what love really means just by
  looking at it. He is such pure goodness and does so much for so many.
  Please help me give this gift of color to such a deserving individual.

"DID YOU KNOW? Donny has red/green color deficiency o r
          ""colorblindness"" So while he can see most color he
          struggles to see certain colors or certain colors look
          different to him than to you and I. It's difficult to say if
          he even sees ""real"" colors the way we do. We play
          the ""what color is this?"" game a lot. -Sometimes Don can't
          differentiate between Guacamole and Bean dip without having to
          taste it since sometimes they are the same color to him. -He gave his sister food
          poisoning once because he couldn't tell that the chicken he
          cooked was still pink. (pink tends to look grey to him) -Speaking of which, this one
          time we were playing the Slug Bug game and this light blue beetle was driving by and he
          yelled ""PINK SLUG BUG"" before punching me- he
          cheated and we haven't played that game since. -He has to change the color
          options in his video games. Bad guys = red, team
          members=green, yeah... he can't tell most of the time so he
          ends up losing a lot because he doesn't shoot the bad guy or
          he shoots his own team member. (it's actually pretty cute when
          he plays with his little brother. The little brother sometimes
          coaches him ""Shoot!"" ""Don't shoot!"")
          You'll be surprised how many video games don't give color
          alternatives for red/green -Certain shades of Purple =
          Blue or vice versa in his world. I don't think he could see
          our wedding colors properly. I'm pretty sure he agreed to the
          color because I liked it and didn't want to disappoint me. -I've caught him asking little
          kids what colors were. Not because that's an adult thing to do
          but because he truly doesn't know . -When we shop he usually asks
          me ""what color are these?"" I've rescued him many
          times from buying the worst poop-colored pants. So. Many. Times. There's a ton more stories
          about Don and his color deficiency but it's part of our daily
          life we don't realize how lacking it
          truly is until its put in perspective, which makes for some
          funny stories. He's wanted to get these
          glasses forever. Life happens and we haven't been able to
          splurge on getting them. With your support we'd love for him
          to finally get them! Our goal is to get him two pairs, both
          the indoor and outdoor pair. Of course if we can get one of

"Amazing parents Andrew and Sarah are raising funds to help their
  beautiful twin boys Freddie and Louie, and other children suffering
  from the rare, degenerative condition, CLN5 Batten disease. Freddie and Louie Dawkins are the only known twins in the world with
  this rare form of a rare disease. Born perfectly healthy in 2005, they
  became autistic, blind and recently developed epilepsy. When they were
  diagnosed in 2009, doctors said that without major advancements in
  medical science, there was no hope, no treatment and no cure. In February 2014 Andrew and Sarah decided to fight back through
  ‘Battle Batten’ their very own campaign to exclusively raise money for
  research into CLN5 Batten disease. Originally aiming for just £1,000, they have so far raised an
  incredible £80,000 and unbelievably commissioned two research
  projects. They are the first UK family to privately commission
  research into CLN5 Batten disease; donating funds to the Batten
  Disease Family Association (BDFA), a charity who is managing the
  projects on the family’s behalf. The cash raised in just 12 months has been unexpected, and
  emotionally overwhelming for the family and still, the momentum and
  passion is strong. The family will continue to fundraise for as long
  as they can. Proceeds will be donated to research projects and will
  buy equipment that best offers hope to children with CLN5, including

  did not plan or could ever imagine. So is the case with me being
  diagnosed with Sarcoidosis with advanced Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
  in 2013. A disease that until then I had never heard about. Two years,
  blood tests, numerous x-rays, an open lung biopsy, CT scans, lots of
  visits to the specialist and all kinds of medications later, reality
  finds me practically house-bound on oxygen therapy learning to adjust
  to my new normal.” -Excerpt from Rosemarie Hartnick’s Blog, https://rosemariehartnick.wordpress.com Rosemarie Hartnick is a mother of two stunning boys, Ross and Connor,
  and wife to Pastor Brian Hartnick. Anyone who knows her can attest to
  the driven, selfless, motivating person that she is. Living with
  Pulmonary fibrosis for the past 4 years has taken its toll on her
  family but she refuses to become a victim of her circumstance Pulmonary fibrosis is a disease marked by scarring of the tissue
  inside and between the air sacs in the lungs. When the scar forms, the
  tissue becomes stiff and thicker. This makes it harder for oxygen to
  pass through the walls of the air sac into the bloodstream. Once the
  lung tissue becomes scarred, the damage cannot be reversed. There is
  no cure. Many people with the disease live only about three to five
  years after diagnosis. As a friend and mentee of Rosmarie Hartnick, I am, with a few of my
  friends and family looking to help in any way that I can. The family
  is in need of a portable oxygen machine, a wheelchair, and help with
  month on month medical expenses. Rosemarie has recently undergone some
  rigorous testing at the Groote Schuur Hospital where she may undergo
  the very first double lung transplant to be carried out at the facility. Through a benefit concert, taking place on 1st October 2017,  and
  other efforts, we are looking to raise R50,000 for the Hartnick Family. We need your help to accomplish this. Would you consider donating in
  cash, kind, or time to help us achieve this mission? Please see the

"This year we are celebrating 15 years since the American
    Alliance for Medical Cannabis was founded. Dr. Jay Cavanaugh created
    AAMC to help patients and to educate health professionals, lawmakers
    and the general public about the therapeutic uses of Cannabis. We
    have come a long way since 2001. We now have AAMC Directors in 21
    States, and 26 States plus the District of Columbia have legal
    medical marijuana. The most common question patients ask is “Where can I find a
    doctor who can help me?” Most doctors have not had a chance to learn
    about medical cannabis. They didn’t learn about the endocannabinoid
    system in medical school and they are reluctant to talk about it. The American Alliance for Medical Cannabis is dedicated to
    helping patients. We need your support to increase our staff so that
    we can identify qualified health professionals and provide patients
    with quality medical care. By becoming AAMC certified clinics, health professionals will
    demonstrate that they are informed about the therapeutic use of
    Cannabis. AAMC is trusted by patients. We understand the needs of
    patients. Patients will know that they are being cared for by
    competent doctors. Patients have the right to talk about their use
    of Cannabis with people who know that it’s not just for fun. Our goal is to develop clinics where patients can get complete
    medical care from doctors who know how Cannabis helps. If you would
    like to help, please give AAMC a generous donation today. AAMC certified clinics provide: * Knowledgeable doctors and nurses * Cannabis is part of initial treatment plan when indicated. * Clinics are typical doctor's offices * Full service health care The goal is to develop clinics that have knowledgeable staff to

      motivated me to save up for those enchroma glasses for him. With

      the oranges reds and greens. The only color he was able to pick
      apart, was yellow. They all kind of blend together for him. I

"About us... We are a family of 6 on one
        income. I am a stay at home mom of 4 amazing kids. I have one
        daughter who is 17.  I have two middle sons, ages 14 and 13.
        They have autistic disorders but have come a LONG way with all
        the help and support of friends, family, teachers, coaches,
        therapist and God. Then we had Kyle.  Kyle is our first son who
        is ""normal"" and now I just found out he is moderate
        Protan color blind. Protan is one of the rarer type (1% of color
        blind people are protan).  What does that mean?  Well anything
        with red in it he doesn't see correctly. Purples look blue b/c the red portion of the color purple is
        missing. Red sometimes looks black . Orange and green can look
        like each other. Most stuff looks like a weird brownish green . His world is
        shades of brown/green with blue , yellow , black and white. It breaks my heart because I
        LOVE colors.  I love r a i n b o w s , and crystals and holiday decorations. I love
        fall leaves, flowers , fireworks and M & M's . How do these things
        look to him?  Probably dreary. Kyle is 8 years old and is in
        3rd grade. He LOVES riding his dirt bike , playing soccer,
        building things and helping his dad with what ever project he is
        working on. He is a dare devil and talks nonstop.  We suspected
        for years that he may be colorblind but we didn't understand the
        condition. So when we would do our little tests and ask him
        ""What color is this?"", if he got it right, we assumed
        he could see fine and must be playing a trick on us. Now I get
        it, and it's not that simple. He has learned what we call red and what we call orange.  He
        doesn't however see it like we do.  In fact they are all so
        close in color to him he has a hard time telling them apart at
        all. It all depends on the lighting and how far away the thing
        is. Color blindness runs in my
          family and on my husbands side as well, but we thought we were
          in the clear. Maybe in denial. After having some teachers
          voice their concerns, and the many times he called something
          the wrong color, we  finally just had him
        tested...twice.  I believe it now. It's effecting his school
        situations as well as his sports.  And I would assume,  just his
        everyday enjoyment of life. I know he doesn't know what he's
        missing, but I do. We take seeing in color for granted. Color
        brings joy to us though.  I have probably done all I can to help
        my older boys with their autism, I'd like to do what I can to
        help Kyle. This fundraiser is to raise
          money to buy Kyle a pair of glasses that will help him
        see the colors he's missing.  It helps 75% of people who try
        them.  We have been saving for a few years and we are finally
        taking our kids to Florida for a week in November of this year.
        Kyle's 9th birthday is during this week. We will be spending his
        whole birthday at Disney's Magic Kingdom! We are also going to
        Disney's Animal Kingdom, the ocean, and
          Universal Studio's islands of adventure.  I would LOVE for him
          to see Disney, Universal and the beach in all it's glory with a pair of these glasses. He will also get to see the
        fireworks in full color! PLEASE help my son! Any donation no
        matter how small will make a difference. I want to be able to
        hand him a wrapped gift on the way to Florida and have him open
        it and experience the world the way we see it. IN FULL COLOR!

  because his heart went into congestive heart failure and they had to
  stabilize him and now he is being transported to Omaha VA hospital

    blindness, and a poor boy named Justin is one of them. Enchroma has
    created glasses which enhance colour vision so that individuals may
    see real, uncompromised colour for the first time! Like you and me, Justin wants the good things in life - health,
    love and freedom. But unlike you and me, there is something holding
    him back from his full potential - colour blindness. Justin is a healthy, competitive guy who loves to win. But due to
    extenuating circumstances, he takes the L a lot . At our
    volleyball season opener, he asked me at least five times,
    ""Which line is out?"" After about the third time, I began
    to shout, ""the green one!"" The issue was with the
    designers, who decided to paint lines on the gym floor overlapping
    in every direction, and with Justin, who could see nothing but
    differing shades of dull, similar-looking colours. Our team chose to
    blame the loss on the problem of Justin not being able to see the
    boundaries, definitely not because of his lack of skill. Justin also suffers in matters of love because of his difficulty
    with choosing a matching outfit, which may deter potential mates
    from approaching. The poor guy always needs help when shopping, and
    often asks the non-colour blind population for an opinion on his
    outfit before he goes out into public. Finally, Justin cannot reach the full potential of his freedom
    without possessing the ability to get around. Although driving does
    not always pose an issue, Justin sometimes has difficulty with
    traffic lights. He once said, ""All I know is that if the bottom
    circle is lit up, you stop. If it's the top circle, you go.""
    The real problem occurs when he visits a new place where they think
    it's a good idea to have horizontal traffic lights. As you can see, there are many obstacles for Justin to overcome,
    but it is my hope that Enchroma glasses will start him down the
    right track to achieving his goals! Please support Justin in his
    journey of becoming a man and help him see the real world for the

"Braden needs a heart transplant and has other disabilities. Funds are
  being raised to improve his quality of life so he can live as normally
  as possible and have access to everything he needs to improve
  everyday. Here is his story: Braden was born December 7th, 2009. He was diagnosed in utero with
  Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA). After he was born, things seemed to
  improve and we were sent home from the birthing hospital. Two days
  later, December 14th, 2009, we saw our pediatrician for a routine
  check-up. Dr. Setia discovered Braden had no palpable pulses in his
  legs and we were immediately sent to Pediatric Cardiology Services,
  the office of Dr. Videlefsky’s office. Once arriving there, an
  Echocardiogram and EKG were performed. Dr. V confirmed our fears.
  Braden was then transferred to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at
  Egleston. We handed over our perfect, beautiful baby boy to the
  Cardiac Intensive Care Unit staff. A few hours later, we were allowed
  back into the CICU to see him. He looked so pitiful. He was hooked up
  to so many machines and had IVs and oxygen. It was absolutely unreal
  to see him that way. We were told the Coarctation of the Aorta was
  present and they would be performing surgery. On December 16th, at 9 days old, Braden had his first heart
  surgery. The CoA was repaired. The surgeon also discovered Braden had
  a Hypoplastic Aortic Arch. They did a left subclavian artery flap to
  repair it. This means Braden has no artery in his left arm, they told
  us his body would compensate for the loss. He struggled post-op and
  remained on the ventilator longer than we expected. Once it was
  removed, he drastically declined and they had to intubate him again.
  He slowly began to recover again and finally made it to the step down unit. Finally, on December 23rd, we were able to take our precious
  baby home, just in time for Christmas. He was too weak to suck a
  bottle so he came home with a Nasogastric tube for the majority of his feedings. Unfortunately, on January 4th, Braden began to drastically
  decline and we rushed him into CHOA. Pressures in Braden’s lungs had
  changed and it revealed several VSDs in his heart also known as Swiss
  Cheese VSDs. He underwent his second heart surgery on January 12th,
  2010. The surgeon placed a Pulmonary Artery band to help slow the
  blood flow to his lungs. After struggling yet again to come off the
  ventilator, and needing to be re-intubated, we finally returned home
  on January 19th. Sadly, our stay at home was short lived. Something
  was not right with Braden. We made several trips into the ER for
  respiratory distress. Braden was once again readmitted to the
  hospital. After staying for a week, it was discovered that Braden was
  micro-aspirating. He was aspirating bits of everything he ate, along
  with reflux coming up from his stomach. On March 11th, 2010, Braden underwent his 3rd surgery. He had a
  Nissen Fundoplication and a G-tube inserted. The Nissen Funoplicaton
  wraps the top of the stomach around the bottom of the esophagus to
  tighten things up so nothing can come up from the stomach. He finally
  came home, but was on oxygen due to issues with his pulse ox after all
  the damage that was caused to his lungs. He remained on oxygen for 9
  months. We continued to follow up with our cardiologist, pulmonologist
  and Gastroenterologist. Braden had several hospital admissions from
  his discharge in March until July. In July 2010, Braden underwent a
  heart cath to check things over. We were very blessed to have been
  able to avoid the hospital from August-November .Braden finally was
  strong enough and was removed from Oxygen in November. In December 2010, Braden had another heart cath. It revealed
  that the Pulmonary Artery Band was ready to be removed. On January
  11th, 2011, Braden underwent his 3rd heart surgery and 4th overall
  surgery. The Pulmonary Artery band was removed, an ASD was closed and
  approximately 6 VSDs were closed as well. There was some damage done
  to his heart in the form of dilation and thickening of the heart
  muscles. It was thought to be related to the Pulmonary Artery banding
  and we were optimistic it would slowly improve as time went on. We
  continued to follow up with our doctors, mainly Cardiology. In April
  2012, a heart cath was done. It showed signs of (RCM) Restrictive
  Cardiomyopathy but no official diagnosis was made. We didn’t get
  discouraged and continued following up with the cardiologist. In July, 2012, Dr. Videlefsky recommended we make a visit to
  Dr. Mahle, Egleston’s Transplant doctor. Our lives changed in a way
  they had never changed before. Dr. Mahle not only confirmed the
  diagnosis of RCM, but told us our only option for Braden would be
  transplant. As long as Braden remains stable, we can avoid the
  transplant list but at any time, he could decline. We aren't promised
  tomorrow so we live today! We live each day holding our breath but try to enjoy every
  moment we can with him. We ask for prayers to keep our son stable as
  long as possible. The doctors are projecting that Braden will be
  listed and possibly transplanted within three years from when he was
  diagnosed. We have faith we can go much longer than that, but again,
  no one knows how long we have. Along with the heart defects, Braden carries the clinical
  diagnosis of Noonan Syndrome. This was a spontaneous mutation within
  the genes. He also has hypotonia, reflux, has a feeding tube in his
  tummy, moderate speech delays, oral aversion and moderate sensory
  integration. If you ask him, he will tell you ""I get a new
  heart"" We try our best to help him understand so he isn't fearful

  outcomes for hundreds of children. We are covering our travel and all
  associated expenses. We support this school and local clinics who
  provide additonal care to the surrounding community at large. We are
  working to strengthen community ties. We have worked and will continue
  to work with two local community clinics whom also aid this program. http://www.rekko.org/index_en.html http://www.buckner.org/our-work/guatemala On November 19tth, 2016 we are hosting a fundraiser at the Yakima
  Sports Center. We will be sharing our stories while hostng a silent
  auction and games. Please help us with this fundraiser that will
  enable hundreds of empoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. We support Escuela Proyecto La Esperanza (The
  School of Hope) in Jocotenango, Guatemala because of their ideals and
  accomplishments. In order to improve a population you need empowerment
  and independence. The proven form has been education. This school provides that. Furthermore they understand that
  supporting a child whom faces countless socioeconomic and
  psychological barriers requires a holistic approach. What these
  children face on a near daily basis makes all of our life obstacles
  seem pity. The staff and volunteers here are committed. It's no secret that we
  hold teachers and social workers in the highest regard. The people
  here are an outstanding example of why we feel this way. They
  genuinely care and love the community in which they are improving.
  They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long term and sustainable
  commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless these socioeconomic
  issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any and all
  help is greatly appreciated! Please contact me direclty with any
  questions or concerns. Attached below is our flyer and items to our

"Do you know Michelle, like I know Michelle? I first met Michelle
  almost 8 years ago when we were taking a course together. We became
  fast friends as we shared a love of family, food and life. Her
  positive and caring spirit along with her amazing sense of humor have
  always inspired me. She has made a career as an incredibly talented
  Stylist and has shared her passion with a great many colleagues and
  students over the past 23 years. Just over a year ago, upon returning home from a business trip to
  California, Michelle started experiencing minor symptoms of not
  feeling well and knew that something was off. There is no way any of
  us could have predicted what would follow. It turned out that Michelle
  was in Congestive Heart Failure and was taken by Air Ambulance out of
  Williams Lake so that further diagnostic tests could be performed. Her
  husband Jamie was working out in the middle of the Chilcoltin and it
  was uncertain if we would be able to contact him. By the efforts of an
  amazing friend, he was reached and given the shocking news that his
  wife was in Cardiac Failure. The results of these early test had her
  referred to much more specialized Doctors in Vancouver at St. Paul's
  Hospital. She was admitted to hospital to undergo more specialized and
  invasive tests and underwent surgery to implant a Cardiac
  Defibrillator. Immediately prior to discharge Michelle was informed
  that she would need to have a Heart Transplant and that she would need
  to be on a regimen of extensive medications and dietary restrictions
  to stabilize her heart while we waited for transplant. This was
  shocking news to say the least. Michelle had been tested from an early
  age on a regular basis because a heart condition ran in her family.
  Her older brother died of a sudden cardiac event at age 15 in 1982 and
  her Father in January of 1990. No cardiac symptoms presented in
  Michelle and by age 32 she figured that she didn't have the genetic
  defect, and like so many others, found herself without a Family
  Physician so did not undergo further cardiac testing for over a decade. Michelle has not been able to work since May of 2016 and has had to
  travel to Vancouver from Williams Lake several times over the last
  year to see the team of Transplant Doctors. With becoming a single
  income household, she is anxious as to how to pay for the upcoming
  expenses that will be incurred for Transplant, a burden she does not
  want to leave to her Husband, Jamie, to figure out. Recently Michelle and Jamie were evacuated from their home due to the
  wildfires surrounding their hometown here in BC. They spent 3 weeks
  away from home and it was while they were evacuated that Michelle got
  the news that she is now ""active"" on the Transplant list.
  This means that BC Transplant is actively looking for a Donor Heart
  match for her and that they could get the call at anytime. Michelle will have to remain in Vancouver post-surgery in order to be
  monitored for symptoms of rejection and infection. She will not be
  able to be on her own in the weeks and months immediately following
  surgery and it is anticipated that she will have to remain in
  Vancouver for up to 12 months to participate in the rehabilitation process. I have always known Michelle to be kind and thoughtful and usually is
  happiest helping others or feeding people. She has a joyful and
  generous spirit and is beloved by many but especially friends and
  family. Will you help Michelle and Jamie and alleviate the pressure of
  this monumental journey they are about to go through? Even the
  smallest donation will help. Please donate today and help this very
  special person not have to worry and be focused on her recovery.","7,950",of $30k goal,https://fundrazr.com/newheartformichelle,Please help us fund Michelle's Heart Transplant,53,"Jul 1, 2018",Canadian Dollar

"OUR GAME PLAN We are looking into effective alternative treatments to try to
    save Mom's life. She needs cancer-killing herbs, roots, oils, a raw
    foods diet, and we might even consider a trip to the States to a
    cancer clinic that has had a high success rate in treating people
    with cancer, plus we’re trying to get her moved back to B.C. so she can be
    near to family during this difficult time. The costs she faces are considerable, and unfortunately,
    alternative treatments aren’t recognized or covered under most
    health plans, and standard treatments also entail costs, both of
    which are looming on the horizon. Mom has grappled with health problems for years and suffers with
    pain each day, and yet in spite of this, she has reached out to help
    others heal emotionally. I’m praying that in her time of need, her friends and
    acquaintances will come to her aid. This would pave the way for her to get the treatments she needs
    to win this terrible battle she faces. ABOUT MY MOM From an early age, Mom shared a deep bond with animals. She
    traveled to the tropics and was captivated by the parrots there. In
    later years, she worked with abused parrots and rehabilitated them,
    teaching them to trust and love again. My mom has always been deeply touched by music and she is a
    talented guitarist and plays the piano. One of her favorite piano
    pieces is Clair de Lune by Debussy. She’s also an author and needs more time to finish and publish
    the books she was working on before she fell ill. She is my mother and a loving grandmother and we don't want her
    life cut short, nor have her torn away from us. One of her greatest
    wishes is to have more years to spend with us. LET’S HELP MAKE HER WISHES COME TRUE If you decide to donate to this fundraiser, any gift, whether
    large or small, will be deeply appreciated, and we thank you from
    the bottom of our hearts. Your actions may make a huge difference to
    Mom’s life and to all those who care about her and who don’t want to
    lose her.","1,650",of $20k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41FO1c,PLEASE HELP SAVE MY MOM,14,,Canadian Dollar

"Their Story Hello Everyone, My name is Carrie and I have the
      pleasure of being a daughter and an Aunt to wonderful people. My
      father is in his 60s and has spent his entire life not being able
      to see all the colors in the rainbow. He has had carpenter jobs
      and has worked with cars, but has always had limitations. My
      father's art is truly amazing, but there is never colors. I want
      him to be able to add colors to his art and not have limitations.
      My two nephews will also spend a life without all the colors
      unless we can change that. The other day I pointed out a rainbow
      that was in the sky before I realized that they might not see it.
      The rainbow was faint appearing. My nephew must have stared in the
      sky for a good ten minutes trying to see it all. I want to give
      the gift of color vision to my family. Please contribute by
      donating and sharing their story. I hope to raise enough money to
      at least buy adult Enchroma glasses for my father to wear and the
      boys to try on, but it would be awesome if they all could have

"Cancer is an illness that change the life of who is living
  it , and the people who is surround. Due to this pathology,
  the routine, habits and custom of the child and the family, are
  strongly altered. Chemonkey is a project for kids who are living chemotherapy process,
  during the investigation, we realized that there wasn't any
    guide that the parents could use to explain their kids what
  they were living or were about to live. This is a hard task to do,
  because they don't know how to do it and the proper words to use. The
  main aim of this project is to ensure the kid's emotional well-being,
  to improve his experience and also to prepare him, so that he can
  face, in a better way, all the process. Chemonkey works as a tool for explaining, by an optimistic way and
  with proper words, the treatment and the side effects of it. So kids
  could understand their illness. The main character of the book is a
  monkey, who already lived the treatment, it shares his experience and
  will be their new best friend, who will share all this time with them.
  It increases kid's well being and help them to say their feelings,
  what really matters during this time. (We tested the prototypes with three kids, in all of them
    increased their self esteem , some of them believed that if her monkey could do it, she could
    too. They became brave and stop cover their eyes because of the
    needles. Also, it helps to the parents, because kids reflected
    themselves in the monkey, so if the monkey wants to sleep, they are
    trying to say that they're tired, so that is really helpful for the
    parents to know the emotions of their child) Please consider giving a donation to this project, any amount will
  help. Whether you can give or not, please share this widely with
  friends on facebook, twitter, e-mail, or any other social media. The more people who see this project, more kids will be
  happy - developing physical, emotional, spiritual, mental and
  social strength in the kids who receive this kit. The monkey hangs in their neck and chest, so it protects their port.",900,of $25k goal,https://fundrazr.com/chemonkey,Chemonkey,12,"Dec 31, 2017",U.S. Dollar
"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for

"My name is Ania. I am proud to introduce you a brave, little boy Adaś
  who was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) ( http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Spinal-muscular-atrophy/pages/introduction.aspx )
   is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and progressive loss
  of movement. Type 1 is the most severe and in most cases causes severe
  respiratory problems which means that children rarely survive beyond
  two years of age. 1 in 5000 children is born with SMA around the world. Please join this SMA fundraising challenge and help Adaś to continue
  his experimental therapy treatment. Adaś Skrzypek  was born just
  before Christmas with the worst type of SMA, type 1. His parents were
  told that he would not reach his first birthday. The doctors informed
  them that there is no cure for SMA at the moment and all they could do
  was to wait for the worst, while his muscles slowly withered away
  until his respiratory system failed and cause Adaś to suffocate. But,
  despite terrifying diagnosis, Aneta and Tomasz Skrzypek, Adaś’s
  parents didn’t give up. They started a daily rehabilitation regime for
  Adaś and started searching around the world for a cure. Adaś's
  condition deteriorated quickly which meant he was no longer offered
  experimental therapies in Europe. He was now not able to swallow or
  breathe properly and was fitted with a tracheotomy tube. Adaś nearly
  died several times but he is a little fighter and was able to start an
  experimental therapy which his parents had found. They didn’t give up
  after being refused help in Europe and they searched around the world
  finally coming across a new treatment in America. The therapy involves
  an injection every 45 days and oral medications in between. Adaś was
  given the first injection just before he turned 6 months old. And a
  tiny mirracle had happened!! Adaś was able to breathe for 20 minutes
  all by himself for the first time in a very long time. He was also
  able to slightly move his head and suck a dummy. There is a realistic
  chance that the experimental therapy that Adaś is receiving will be
  successfull. But unfortunately the cost of the treatment have exceeded
  his parents financial capabilities. The cost of it is 80000 polish
  zlotych (£15,000) every 45 days, and this sum will increase once the
  doses get stronger. By helping Adaś, we are helping children around the world who have
  been or may be born with incurable SMA. We can make a difference and
  change the world. We are giving hope to all the parents who were told
  that the only thing they could do was to give up and wait for the
  worst. Please help by donating any amount in polish zlotych (PLN) or
  the equivalent in another currency and sharing it on Facebook. We can
  spread the word and be a part of something amazing!! We can save
  children all around the world. * You are most welcome to donate as much as you wish. FundRarz and

  wczesnodziecięcy jest najpoważniejszy. Objawy choroby pojawiają sie
  zaraz po urodzeniu lub do szóstego miesiąca życia. Dziecko rzadko ma
  szansę przeżycia dwóch lat. 1 na 5000 dzieci na świecie rodzi sie z SMA. Adaś Skrzypek jest malutkim chłopczykiem, który urodził się 20
  grudnia 2015 roku w Tarnowie. Adaś jest chory na SMA typ 1. Jego
  rodzice, Aneta i Tomasz Skrzypek, przed Wigilią dowiedzieli się, że
  ich długo wyczekiwany synek może nie doczekać swoich pierwszych
  urodzin. Lekarze nie dawali Adasiowi żadnych szans. Jedyne co Państwo
  Skrzypek mogli zrobić, to poddać się i czekać, aż mięśnie Adasia
  zwiotczeją, a uklad oddechowy przestanie działać i Adaś sie udusi.
  Jednak rodzice Adasia z pełną determinacją podjęli poszukiwania
  eksperymentalnej terapii w Europie, która dałaby szansę Adasiowi.
  Niestety po początkowym zakwalifikowaniu Adasia do jednej z terapii,
  stan chłopca pogorszył sie na tyle, że odmówiono jego leczenia. Adaś
  był kilka razy bliski śmierci, ale jest malutkim wojownikiem i przeżył
  po to, by móc wziąść udział w eksperymentalnej terapii, którą znaleźli
  jego rodzice. Nie poddali sie kiedy odmówiono Adasiowi leczenia w
  Europie i rozpoczęli poszukiwania na szeroką skalę na całym świecie,
  aby wreszcie znaleźć nadzieję w Ameryce. Chłopczykowi zaproponowano
  terapię w trakcie, której co 45 dni dostaje zastrzyk, a w między
  czasie przyjmuje leki doustne. Adaś pierwszy zastrzyk dostał niedługo
  przed swoim 6 miesiącem życia. I stał sie maleńki cud!! Adaś był w
  stanie samodzielnie oddychać przez 20 minut, czego nie mógł robić już
  od długiego czasu. Mógł również lekko poruszać główką i trzymać
  smoczek w buźce. Nie mógł tego robić od wielu tygodni. Jest realna
  szansa, że ta eksperymentalna terapia, której Adaś jest poddawany,
  będzie zakończona sukcesem. Niestety, koszt terapii przerósł
  możliwości finansowe rodziców Adasia. Jej koszt, to 80 tysięcy złotych
  co 45 dni. Może to ulec zwiększeniu, kiedy dozy staną się mocniejsze.
  Pomagając Adasiowi, pomagamy dzieciom na całym świecie, które już są
  lub urodzą się chore na nieuleczalną chorobę rdzeniowego zaniku mięśni
  (SMA). Możemy zmienić ich świat i dać nadzieję rodzicom, którym
  powiedziano, że jedyną rzeczą, którą mogą zrobić, to poddać się i
  czekać na najgorsze. Proszę, pomóżcie Adasiowi wpłacając datki w

"Joe was disgnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in 2007 aged 5. We
  had never even heard of it, but once we knew what it meant our hearts
  broke and our world came crashing down around us. You see our
  beautiful, funny, smart child was poorly and he would never get better. Most children with Duchenne lose the ability to walk by the age of
  12, then the rest of their body starts to fail. Before long they can
  no longer raise their arms to feed themsleves or to give you a hug. By
  mid teens they are usually having to use ventilators to
  breathe and using machines to help them cough. Then they get probelms
  with their heart and lungs and they become too weak to fight anymore.
  There is no treatments or cure, so we watch as our child deteriorates
  by the day, knowing there is nothing we can do about it. From day one we have had a battle with the authorities to fund
  equipment, to seek suitable accomodation, to get the right school for
  him, to find funds to get a vehicle that can take his wheelchair. Its
  has been horrendous, soul destroying and incredibly expensive. It was
  made all the worse in Feb 2015, when Joe fell and fractured his spine.
  Life drastucally changed over night as he went from being able to
  walk, in the house, to no longer being able to walk at all and now has
  to rely on us, for everything.... To dress him, to pick things up he
  has dropped, to help him go to the toilet, to scratch an itch, to
  clean him, to bathe him and some times feed him when the fatigue sets
  in and he just doesnt have the strength. He was 12 when this happened. Yet, despite his illness, Joe continues to smile and continues to be
  a rainbow in our thundery skies. He deserves to be able to live in a
   home where he feels comfortable, where he knows he is safe and can
  move freely, where there is the equipment to support his failing body
  with out being afraid his parents are going to drop him because we
  have to lift him. He deserves to be able to get out and about not be
  house bound. He deserves a happy life. He deserves the best life...
  before it's too late. Please, please help to fund for the life changing equipment Joe needs. If you fancy doing a fundraiser for HOPE FOR JOE, please do get in

"In a short 24 hours.... Our lives changed forever! On April 30th, 2017 Paul De Lio, our youngest brother, was rushed to
  the emergency room dept after collapsing at home, while battling with
  what he was told by a walk-in clinic doctor, was nothing more than a flu. For 15 days, Paul was in a medically induced coma and on life support
  while doctors were frantically fighting to save his life!! Paul was infected by a bacteria called ""Invasive Group A
  Strep"", and went into Septic Shock after the bacteria infected
  his blood and his organs began to shut down, from Toxic Shock Syndrome
  (read more here: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/what-you-need-to-know-about-group-a-strep-infections/article34391674/ ). 5 out of 100,000 Canadians suffer from this per year. Paul is currently still in ICU at Scarborough General Hospital after
  being transferred there from Toronto General Hospital, and is at risk
  for organ damage in his lungs and heart, his kidneys are functioning
  at 0% capacity, and his lower limbs are at risk for amputation. He is
  currently on daily dialysis, and has not recovered most of his
  physical abilities. Paul is a healthy, 31 year old substitute elementary school teacher.
  He loves teaching younger children and especially loves sports, namely
  soccer, where he volunteered his time to coach 4 teams, ranging from
  ages 12 -16. He is also in the process of completing his
  professional refereeing licenses. Paul recently purchased his first home, a condo close to home, where
  he was planning to move in after completion in 2 years. Our mother has been by his side each and every day and night, leaving
  her job to do what a mother does, care for their sick child. Your help and generosity will ensure all of Paul and our family's
  future financial expenses and medical costs are covered, namely the
  3-6 months of rehab and prosthetic costs, Paul and our mother's time
  away from work (neither has any benefits), and you will also ensure
  Paul will not lose his first home that he worked very hard to obtain! Our little brother has kept his spirits up, and has fought so hard to
  get this far.... But a new fight begins with new challenges and
    a long road ahead... Please share your prayers and financial support
    to encourage Paul in this battle. Love, The De Lio family","160,638",,https://fundrazr.com/FORZAPAUL,Please help Paul continue his fight!,,,
"Robert Seth Hayes is one of the longest held political prisoners in
  the US. After returning from the Vietnam War, Seth joined the Black
  Panther Party and was later imprisoned for his involvement in the
  struggle for Black Liberation. Seth was sentenced to 25 years to life, which means after
  serving 25 years he is eligible for parole. Seth has now been locked
  in prison for 42 years and unjustly denied parole on 10 occasions.
  Seth has a large and loving family and supportive community who yearn
  for his release. Seth turns 67 this year and suffers from multiple
  chronic medical problems. We are waging a campaign for Seth concerning his ailing health.
  With proper medical care, Seth's health issues could be under control
  but the horribly inadequate health care during his incarceration
  places him at grave risk. The combination of repetitive parole denials
  and neglectful medical care equates to a extrajudicial death sentence
  for Seth. In addition struggling to receive medical care, Seth is also
  fighting for his constitutional rights at the parole board. Seth is a
  model prisoner and meets all criteria for release, yet has been
  repetitively denied parole for no other reason than ""the serious
  nature of the original crime."" This essentially means that the
  Parole Board is taking it upon themselves to re-sentence Seth to life
  in prison without the possibility parole. Seth is challenging this
  violation of his constitutional rights with a Habeas petition. Seth needs our support. Please make a contribution to this
  campaign to win justice and freedom for a brother who has sacrificed
  so much for us all!","3,278",of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/810a58,Support Black Panther Robert Seth Hayes!,76,,U.S. Dollar
"My son Andrew will be 27 this January, and has been colour
      blind for as long as I can remember. As a kid, he learned to adapt
      to his surroundings and distinguish certain colours based on what
      he knows to be constants ie: grass, blue sky. Andrew is an artist so he spends a good amount of time
      guessing actual colours but has integrated his knowledge of the
      Colour Wheel to help him draw and paint. As a person who can see
      in true colour, I am quite impressed at his interpretations and
      knowledge of actual colours. As his mom, it pains me to know that
      he cannot truly see the beauty of his own work or that of his
      colleagues. We have learned to adjust as his family. I tend to forget
      who I am talking to when I ask him to grab something out of the
      cupboard, or to find something for me. Instead of saying, ""I
      need the red bottle"", I have to describe the shape of the
      bottle or labels. Basic chores like cleaning up a spill can be
      irritating for Andrew because apple juice can blend in with the
      pattern of the counter top. Unless there is a distinct contrast,
      he can't see it. Andrew doesn't drive because he can't see the
      street lights or car lights. Gaining employment is difficult
      because he cannot see most Point of Sale computer screens,
      resulting in low self-esteem. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are
      not a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type
      and extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses
      are estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of
      red-green color vision deficiency. Andrew might never be able to drive but we believe that his
      employment opportunities will open up and his artistic world will
      expand, resulting in higher self-esteem and improvement in his
      quality of life. Since Andrew wears prescription lenses, we are
      asking for $400 to help pay for Enchroma Prescriptive Lenses
      through our local optometrist. Please help us give Andrew the gift of colour for his
      Birthday in January. Any amount will help, and if you cannot
      contribute financially, please share this campaign to help spread
      the word. Thank you so much! Tamara (Mom) Check out these reactions",125,of $400 goal,https://fundrazr.com/andrew_birthday,Give Andrew the Gift of Colour for his Birthday,4,"Dec 31, 2017",U.S. Dollar
"WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Hey all, so apparently we live in the future and they have these
  awesome glasses that let colorblind people see color! I wanted to get
  these for my dad for Christmas and am fully prepared to pay the $350
  for them, but thought it would be selfish to give such an amazing gift
  myself, when there are so many of you out there who love and admire
  this incredible man.  I think it would be even more of an awesome
  experience to share with him a list of people he has influenced
  throughout his life who wanted to share in giving him this gift.  I
  would love so much to present him with a short note from each of you
  expressing your love and appreciation along with this present as I
  think it would mean so much to him.  For those of you who know him,
  you know what an amazing friend, husband, father, grandfather, bishop,
  coach, youth leader, missionary, home teacher and donut connoisseur
  he's been throughout his life.  Please join me in giving back and
  making this life changing experience more amazing that it could
  possibly be. Any amount will be greatly appreciated and the goal is to
  have them by Christmas. I will be covering any difference so this will
  for sure happen.  Read below for all the technical mumbo jumbo and

      aren’t moving. It takes him several minutes to find his car let

      finding his colorful tooth brush every morning. He just can’t see
      these things. It’s a terrible life to live and I thing we should
      work together to help end his struggle. Edit: I have been told that those who are colorblind can see
      things the same way us normal human beings can, just with some
      colors not registering the same way we see them. I apologize for

"Hey Everyone! For those of you who don't know, my 5 year old son Victor is
  Protan color blind. What does that mean? To break it down, he can see some colors but not most. For example, super bright shades
  of color he can usually pick up on so long as the lighting in the room
  or outside is good. Other shades of color (especially darker colors)
  all begin to look the same. Some examples? I asked my son to
  tell me what colors the following texts are. These are the colors and
  his responses: What color is this? Orange! So what color does this look like to him? Green! How about this color? What
            does he see? Purple! What color does he see here? Brown He knows that he is color
                blind but doesn't really understand it. How do you explain to
              someone that the color they see isn't really the color
              they see? Being color blind has
                caused interference with his lessons and daily play. He does the best he can
                despite being color blind and reassures me when he
                sees the look on my face. The one I get when I'm too heartbroken to let him
                know he got a color wrong. Like the day we drove by an
                orange excavator. He loves excavators and gleefully
                pointed it out. Only, he called it blue. I asked him to
                repeat what he had said. He hesitantly told
                me...""blue?""... I tried to put on my most
                cheerful voice and tell him he was right, that it was a
                beautiful blue excavator. But he knew already that he
                had gotten it wrong. I have a terrible poker face. He
                smiled and told me that it was ok because I was going to
                buy him super hero glasses so that he could see colors.
                I cheerfully agreed with him hoping he didn't hear my
                voice crack from the strain of trying not to cry. My pain that day wasn't from my son being color
                blind. My pain was from the promise echoed from my son.
                That Mommy will buy him ""super hero glasses""
                so that he can see colors. I made him that promise the
                day we found out he was color blind. And I have worked
                so hard ever since that day to make good on my promise
                to my son. Wouldn't you know that life keeps getting in
                the way? I'm sure everyone who reads this will
                understand what I mean by that. Every single time my
                husband and I start gathering up enough spare money to
                buy our son his Enchroma glasses something happens to
                set us back financially. Car dying, expensive dental
                care, new roof, etc, etc. The list continues as life
                continues. It's beyond frustrating to begin with for
                anyone. But to know that every time something happens it
                is another month (and another, and another, and
                another...) that I can't make good on my promise to my
                son... well that, as I'm sure you already know if you
                are a parent, is gut wrenching. To the point where I'm
                now doing something I never thought I'd do...I'm asking
                for help. I've never met anyone who likes asking
                for help including myself. Sure I'll ask for help
                reaching something too high up or perhaps an extra hand
                to help carry in the groceries. But humbling myself to
                ask for help on a financial level is something I try to
                avoid doing at all costs. However, for my son, I will. So if you are reading this, and if you have any
                capacity and desire to help, I am asking you for it. I
                do not ask lightly. I really doubt I'll ever be able to
                pay you back which is why it makes this so hard for me.
                I don't mind asking for something I can repay. It's
                having to ask people for nothing more than their sheer
                kindheartedness and generosity that humbles me because
                it leaves me feeling as vulnerable as a sinner asking
                The Lord for forgiveness. I feel unworthy of it. I
                question if I even have such a right to ask for it. Yet,
                out of hope, I ask anyway. If you are wondering,
                the color blind gene is carried from the mother's side.
                My father is also Protan color blind. I want desperately
                to buy him glasses too. He told me to worry about my son
                first and not him. If (for some miracle) this campaign
                actually goes far enough to get money for two glasses,
                you bet I'm getting them for my Dad. I want him to see
                the true colors of a sunset after 70 years of not really
                knowing what it is he's been seeing all this time. I'm already asking for so much...but if you can
                help either financially or by spreading the word by
                sharing this campaign for me I will be truly grateful
                beyond expression of words. My deepest gratitude

    doesn't remove the spleen quickly, she will have no future at all.
    So in other words....it is very critical. Watch a short video about Malika and her mother (in Russian). Malika loves to play with dolls and to sew doll clothes. Her
    other hobby is to have fun with play doh, as you can see in the
    video. She has one younger brother and lives together with her
    family (Mrs. Tahmina and Mr. Pope
    Ravshan) in Bishkek. Read a background story on this Kyrgyz website for more info
    (in Russian, use your browser's translator). How much money do we need? Important EU-citizens: Problems with donating
    by Paypal or Creditcard? Contact us and we will provide an IBAN nr. Malika and her family are desparetly in need of money for an operation to remove Malika's spleen and medication
    afterwards . We have no idea yet how much this will cost,
    but the operation will costs $ 2.000.  So fare we have collected 420
    dollars. The amount you see in this page is also the total of the
    first goal: get Malika to Russia to see a specialist. Now, to put things in perspective: Malika's father
      (Pope) earns $150 per month as a taxi driver. Don't be
    surprised; this is a decent income in Kyrgysztan. However, you'll
    understand this is not enough to pay hospital bills. For Russian speaking people Ниже мои данные для перевода денег: Исакова Надира, номер карты 4276380040163409 Read Russian update Information about Hereditary Spherocytosis Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a disorder of the surface, called
  the membrane, of your red blood cells. It causes your red blood cells
  to be shaped like spheres instead of flattened discs that curve
  inward. The spherical cells are less flexible than normal red blood
  cells. Malika has the severe and more rare type. Spherocytosis causes your red blood cells to break down faster than
  healthy cells do, which can lead to anemia. If spherocytosis causes
  anemia, you may appear paler than normal. Other common symptoms of
  anemia from hereditary spherocytosis can include: Symptoms fatigue shortness of breath irritability dizziness or lightheadedness increased heart rate headache heart palpitations jaundice Gallstones Cause Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by a genetic defect. If you have a
  family history of this disorder, your chances of developing it are
  higher than someone who does not. People of any race can have
  hereditary spherocytosis, but it’s most common in people of Northern
  European descent. Sources: visit this website “If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want

  most kids, fighting with his brother and sister. In October 2011, Sebastian was diagnosed with Stage IV
  Neuroblastoma, a cancer that starts in the nerve cells, and is rarely
  found in children over the age of 4. He is nearing the end of a long,
  difficult road. His initial treatments were at St. Louis
    Childrens. He has endured 6 rounds of high-dosage chemotherapy, a
    bone marrow transplant, 18 bone marrow biopsies, a major surgery to
    remove a large mass from his abdomen, and countless tests and scans.
    He had 2 rounds of mibg radiation therapy in Cincinnati, OH, and 40
    rounds of palliative radiation at Carle Hospital in Champaign, IL.
    He also received treatment at Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago,
    where he had a team of oncologists who specialize in Neuroblastoma.
    We were unable to improve his disease. In July 2014, following
    complications due to chemo, Sebastian decided to stop treatment.

  Queer Voices column. Earlier this year following evidence of being
  stalked, I was raped, and survived an attempt to drug me and leave me
  in a trap-house by certain individuals, some of whom have personally
  *claimed* connection to my ex-wife's family. For the past 10 months, this has left me mentally shattered,
  without support from many of my previous network who have withdrawn
  from me on account of respectability politics and rumors, and moving
  from place to place all over the country in an attempt to find any
  sense of stability and rebuild my life, which has made finding
  additional work (which was previously unnecessary), incredibly
  difficult when coupled with the obstacles my transness and
  neurodivergeance (I suffer from clinically diagnosed PTSD, and
  Adjustment Disorder, which I am also currently unable to afford
  treament for), already place on me. I am raising these funds to afford my medically necessary, and
  prescribed Hormone Replacement Therapy, consisting of Finasteride and
  Spironolactone for Testosterone blocking, and Estrogen and
  Progesterone, and prescribed by my endocrinologist and Planned
  Parenthood on the basis of my biological necessity for this treatment
  as an intersex transgender woman. Being on these hormones has a
  positive effect on my mental stability, and physical wellbeing. Having
  to go without them is inadvised, and results in documented mental
  instability, depression, and uncontrollable anger, and physical
  deterioration, including muscular atrophy, rapid weight loss on
  account of an inability to maintain healthy body fat, chronic
  diarrhea, and immune system compromise. If you can help at all, I'm asking that you please do. I don't
  like having to crowdfund for this need, it's a huge blow to the pride
  I take in my work, and myself, but I also recognize that in a
  situation like this, it is important to be able to recognize when I
  *must* swallow my pride and seek the help I need. I know that my
  friends and family care about my wellbeing, and recognize that this is
  not a matter of choice, or comfort, but an unfortunate medical need on

  than being a physical discomfort while biking, swimming, exercising,
  in change rooms, singing, during hot weather giving skin irritations
  etc...psychologically it is something I want to move on from as a part

  around more easily and exist a lot more safely in public like at the

  something in return so I've added lots of 'perks' as this website
  calls them. I am an artist and printmaker so please take this
  opportunity to get some art, clothing or comics from me. This will
  also help clear out my studio and get me pumped to make some new work

    in October and friends for 6 years. Michael has worked since he was
    14. He had a great work ethic and worked not only his full time job
    but numerous side jobs. He was a mechanic and
    painter a nd his main career was for 30+years as a
    Manager and District Manager in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to
    pay for his rides to therapy, Doctors visits etc. Our medical bills are mounting and there has been no place to
    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the
    numerous supplements that he has to take. If all bills get paid with
    this campaign, I'd also be exlploring hyperbaric treatment; studies

"Hi, I’m Claudia, Abi's mother, Abi suffers from a weird disease
    here in México called Axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy Charcot
    Marie Tooth ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcot%E2%80%93Marie%E2%80%93Tooth_disease ). It's more common in Europe And The United States Abi was born like a normal person. She used to climb a lot, to
    run, to jump, to swim ... until one day at the age of 5 years old I
    saw that she started limping and walking in 1000 different ways
    until she ended up walking like a duck - with both feet sticking out. Then I started to visit a bunch of the best doctors in the
    country to find an answer until they told me it was a weird
    hereditary progressive disease with no cure. They told me that her
    life since that day would be limited. She would need to be cared for
    24/7 as well as daily therapies that would help her to continue
    walking. Since that day I have been taking care of Abi 24/7. Over time her disease has evolved, making almost all of her
    muscles from half thigh to the toes disappear. There is no muscles
    from the knees to the toes it's like the bottom part of her knees
    doesn't exist. By the evolution of the disease, the doctor told me that she
    needs a new orthosis because of her height (1.75m) and weight (69kg)
    she has. The orthosis that she have right now does not do the function it
    used to do. The new orthosis we want to buy will give her more support and
    stability for her actual weight and height. Right now she is in bed
    because she fell last Monday and she broke her ankle. The reason why was because her orthosis that she has currently
    does not work properly. Unfortunately a fall for her it is extremely
    dangerous. However for normal human beings a fall is nothing. If we
    break one of our bones we just rest and will get well soon. For Abi
    it is different. She would have to rest for 2/3 months while missing
    out school and possibly losing the capacity she has to walk. I have no one to support me. This illness is not only hard work
    but is also time consuming. The father quit four years ago and so
    have all our family members. The government here do not support you
    with anything. It is just Abi, my son and me. Because Abi requires
    24/7 care I am not able to get a job. I can’t just leave her in the
    house home alone. I have had to sell my car to survive some months
    which has affected the care and the therapies that she needs. That
    is why I beg you to help to buy her a new orthosis so she can
    continue walking, to see the possibility to have a used car so I can
    take her to the therapies and school, so she can continue walking
    some steps, so she can start so she can start high school, continue
    studying and continue having excellent grades and adjustments in the
    house (a special bathroom and a ramp). She has an intact
    intellectual capacity that the disease can not touch and according
    to medical diagnosis, it will not touch. This is why I fight, so
    that she can have a normal life and not be locked up at home because
    she can’t walk. Please pray for Abi. Share this with all your friends and
    familiars so that we can get the goal and let Abi have a better
    life. We just want her to be able to walk like any other person.

  successivement enseigné dans les centres communautaires, les écoles,
  les milieux du sport professionnel (RIO, CEPSUM), de la santé
  (Institut de Cardiologie de Montréal, Hôpital du Sacré-Cœur de
  Montréal) et de l'enseignement supérieur (Université de Montréal). Au début des années 2000, Anne dirigeait sa propre école. Enseigner
  était sa passion, une passion que ses élèves lui rendaient bien. Ses
  classes remportaient un franc succès, année après année. Dans ses
  cours, Anne faisait découvrir, avec l'énergie qui la caractérise, le
  bonheur de bouger et de danser. Communicatrice hors pair, elle
  permettait aux femmes de se mettre en forme, de s’exprimer à l’aide de
  leur propre langage corporel, d’affirmer leur féminité, d’acquérir et
  garder confiance en elles. Courage et détermination Anne a un message d'espoir à transmettre aux gens qui, comme elle,
  souffrent de douleur chronique. Un message d'autant plus fort qu'il
  s'appuie sur une expérience vécue alliant courage, résilience, et une
  irrésistible soif de vivre. Anne ne peut plus enseigner le
  stretching-danse? Qu'à cela ne tienne : elle peut parler,
    partager, faire profiter à ceux aux prises avec la douleur
  chronique de l'expérience qu'elle a acquise dans la gestion de ses
  propres douleurs. Pour ce faire, Anne a de grands et beaux projets :

"My name is Manichanh, I am a part of a
  small group of health care workers whom are dedicated to improving
  lives of those less fortunate. In addition to assisting locally, we
  also travel to one of the poorest neighborhoods in Guatemala where we
  support The School of Hope  and Rekko Clinic. http://www.eftc.org.uk/our-work and http://www.rekko.org/index_en.html We are making our annual trip to Jocotenango, Guatemala in September
  2017.  We support a program that improves the lives of hundreds of
  improverished children. We cover our own travel and all associated
  expenses. We are asking you to help us raise funds for this school so
  that the children can obtain medical care at local clinics and
  hospitals. We continue to work with a local clinc and strengthen those
  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679
      students across the Foundation. On November 18, 2017 we are hosting a fundraiser at the Yakima Sports
  Center. We will be sharing our stories while hosting a silent auction,
  having a split the pot or 50/50 (winner took home almost $200 last
  year!) and games. Please help us with this fundraiser that will enable
  hundreds of impoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. In order to improve a population you need
  empowerment and independence. The proven form has been education.
  These children face countless socioeconomic and psychological
  barriers. A holistic approach is required to improve longterm
  outcomes. What these children face on a near daily basis makes all of
  our life obstacles seem pity. The staff and volunteers provide long
  term commitment. They genuinely care and love the community in which
  they are empowering. They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long
  term and sustainable commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless
  these socioeconomic issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any
  donation is greatly appreciated. These children are combating extreme
  poverty and many face inhuman conditions. This school provides a safe
  haven where they can break the cycle of poverty. All donations go
  directly to medical cost and does not cover any administration fees.
  We have never needed as much support as we are asking for this year.

"Hi All! Most of you know that we have
      had a rough year in terms of work, medical procedures, lack of
      work and more procedures. Ethan finally went in and made
      it out of the heel cord surgery we've been anticipating for months. We found out that Ethan has an
      incredibly high arch and Dr. Dow said there is a chance that he
      will need more surgery. Right now, Ethan is not allowed
      to put any weight on his feet at all, meaning, I must stay home
      with him 24/7 in case of fire or emergency. I have to bathe him,
      help him use the restroom, dress him, feed him, and administer his
      medication, all while still attending online courses. I applied for SSI for Ethan
      over 3 months ago. I have received no response and cannot get
      through to the office. I have written to Senator Tim
      Scott, asking for any information that would point me in the right
      direction for any grants or funding that our particular situation
      could be eligible for. I have also written to the White House with
      the same questions. The only thing I have
      accomplished by reaching out to local, state and fed. gov. is that
      now my email is bombarded with stories of why ""this
      person"" is working for the people, etc... No one from the government (on
      any level) has even acknowledged our concerns, much less responded
      with any sort of advice on where to look. I am a single mom. My son has
      Aspergers. My son makes straight As. I currently have a 4.0 and I
      am actively taking college courses. Ethan's father has never paid
      child support and I cannot pursue him for financial assistance
      since he is not a US citizen. There must be something we are
      eligible for??!! One would think, right? Well, I have yet to find anything. I have always worked. I have
      always been Ethan's provider with the help from immediate family
      when really needed. Ethan does have Medicaid and we
      finally received food stamps. But what of rent? Utilities?
      Toiletries? School supplies? Anything that we cannot eat? It is not anyone's
      responsibility, and I absolutely hate that this is the place I
      have to turn AGAIN since I am not eligible for help since
      I am physically capable of working. Apparently, our situation falls
      in some grey area and no one can really give me an answer on how I
      can find help. If anyone knows of someone who
      can help us find these answers, Please let me know, as I am out of ideas. Once again, We thank you and
      love you so much for all of your continued support and, once more,
      I would never ask unless absolutely urgent and necessary. Thank you all... again. Please share, as the more who
      know, the better chance we can find some answers. Love, Steph and Ethan PS. Ethan is feeling much

"A Message from Maria ... When I picture my friend Col, I envision light—a beautiful, warm,
  loving light. Her aura glows with this willingness to understand and empathize. That’s one of the reasons why this disease she has been battling is
  so difficult for me to come to grips with. It seems to be literally
  eating away at the insides of her physical body, and yet her mind and
  her spirit still keep glowing—still keep pushing on—despite the daily
  obstacles she faces. Col does not like to complain so she doesn't want us to list all of
  her symptoms, which are many. When you see her smiling and laughing
  with you, she's doing it amidst great pain and discomfort. Often it
  feels like she's dying. A number of her doctors don't take insurance and need to be paid out
  of pocket (just one office visit can cost $600!) and the treatment
  they prescribe is also not covered by insurance. She has been sick for
  numerous years so you can imagine the toll that that takes. Her illness is not something you'd know about unless you are close to
  her. But it's very serious and it severely impedes her quality of
  life. And her closest friends and family are very concerned— *We want her to be with us for years to come!* Please join me in doing what you can to help Col win this war within
  her body and pave her road to healing. A Message from Sue Elliott ... Have you ever met somebody — even online — and instantly loved that person? I’m not talking about lust. I’m not even talking about appreciation. What I mean is some sort of deep, soul-level recognition. A
  feeling like “home,” like “It’s so good to see you again after all
  these years! I do so adore you!” That’s how I felt about Col the first time I saw her photo and
  read a comment she had posted online in a business-oriented group
  years ago. Since then, I’ve gotten to know Col “better,” and I still have
  that same feeling. She’s like a cross between an angel, a friend and a sister! We have amazing conversations in which we both let go of all
  kinds of “stuff” that no longer serves us and we experience huge AHA moments! If you had asked me a year or so ago how I felt about Col, I
  would have told you that she’s a dear, dear friend, at the very least. And yet, as close as we had gotten on so many levels, I
  had NO idea that Col was often in severe physical pain. Not only does she not complain about pain, she’s so genuinely
  joyful and inspired and inspiring, it never dawned on me that she
  could be anything but energetic and “healthy.” Her very being exudes well-being! Col wrote a beautiful blog post that illustrates her approach to
  life and living, even in the midst of pain... even in the midst of
  illness. Please take a couple minutes to be inspired by the beauty of
  Col’s approach to — and dance with — life: Dancing in the Rain . Throughout the pain and the illness, Col has been giving to
  others in the most magnificent way. She created a FREE program called Magical Medical Mystery Tour , in which she
  interviewed amazing healers of all kinds. She created a forum in which
  these experts shared their wisdom freely with anyone who cared to
  participate. The gift of these interviews continues to unfold within
  me and, I’m sure, within all who were game for the adventure. So when Col told me that she now has one or two Western medical
  doctors for EACH of her organs! —and as much as she loves and
  appreciates them, Western medicine doesn’t seem to be working for her
  particular illness — I didn’t have to ask if she had tried natural and
  alternative healing modalities. I knew she had — with joy and
  enthusiasm and insight ... And yet, her body still has more to say — more insights to
  reveal — and it wants to reveal those insights and that wisdom through
  biological medicine. Col has received many “nudges” from the universe
  pointing her in that direction — and this is a woman who KNOWS how to
  listen to and dance with the universe. Like all great dances, it’s a two-way experience. There is
  giving and receiving. And there is constant expansion. One of the most obvious — and magnificent — benefits of this
  expansive dance with the universe and with pain and illness has been
  creativity. Everything that Col learns and experiences goes deep
  within her being and comes out as ART! Art with spirit. Art with soul. Art with purpose. And art that
  is infused with the energy of healing and a return to balance and wholeness! If you feel inspired, I encourage you to listen to your soul.
  Listen to your body. Listen to your inner response to Col’s artwork.
  And if something resonates deeply within you, please purchase it. Not only will you be bringing something beautiful and powerful
  into your own home or office, you will be helping to make Col’s dream
  come true, the universe-directed dream to receive biological treatment. I know I will be buying several pieces of Col’s work for myself
  and to give as gifts. And I know I will not be alone. Col is so loved
  by so many! Sue Elliott Founder/Editor-in-Chief of Law of Attraction Magazine www.LovingMyself.com ..................................................

"My parents have had a rough month. In the past month, my parents
  traveled to Texas, twice, due to two unfortunate deaths of my Dad's
  neice, then two weeks later, his sister also passed away. Two weeks
  after returning to the Chicago area, my Dad nearly died after eating,
  yes eating! He had food stuck in his esophagus and tried to wash it
  down and ended up causing his esophagus to burst from the pressure
  (esophageal perforation of the thoracic region and left lung). This
  occurred the Friday after Thanksgiving. After being disagnosed with
  the large tear in his esophagusand adjacent lung, in the thoracic
  region (behind the heart), he was transferred to Rush Memorial
  University Medical Center where he would have died if the emergency
  surgery had not been conducted. He was sedated for two days while intubated. He is battling
  infection, high blood pressure and fluid in his lungs. He is
  conscious, but in no way out of the woods. Due to the nature of this
  injury, he will most likely remain in ICU for another week and in
  hospital for a couple weeks after that. This is where, on behalf of my
  parents, I am asking for support during this holiday season. While my
  parents both have jobs, they have exhausted all their vacation time
  and are currently both without income until the New Year. While there are benefits my Dad will most likely qaulify for, those
  applications and approvals take time. My mother is working with her
  employer to work from home, but she cannot do that until my Dad is
  released from the hospital. My parents are never ones to accept
  financial support, they are often the ones donating to causes and to
  others in need. I can attest that any donations accepted are beyond appreciated and
  will go directly to living expenses. The last thing I want my Dad to
  worry about, when he is fully aware of what is happening, is how his
  injury has caused him to be unable to work. The surgeons keep reminding my mom this is still a life threatening
  injury. I can't make him heal or expedite the recovery. What I can do
  is shed light on their situation and help alleviate one of the stressors. Any contribution is greatly appreciated and if you are unable to
  contribute, sharing this fundraiser is just as appreciated. Thank you so very much, Kristen Meghan","1,463",,https://fundrazr.com/Dennistague,Help the Tague's get through this trying time.,,"Jan 26, 2018",

"Elizabeth Ozuna regiomontana de nacimiento, maestra de profesión y
  apasionada por dejar su legado a muchos niños en el mundo y a toda
  persona que toca en su camino. Por circunstancias familiares emigro a los Estados Unidos y se
  reinventó a si misma al lado de sus hijos Gustavo, Erick, Lizbeth y su
  esposo Humberto. Como muchos inmigrantes empezaron desde abajo,
  tratando de construir un mejor futuro para sus hijos. Tuvieron que
  enfrentar una nueva manera de hacer las cosas y aprender un nuevo idioma. Junto a su esposo crearon la revista” Mi Familia Magazine” cuyo
  objetivo es ayudar a los latinos que migran a Estados Unidos a
  empoderarse para salir adelante y recuperar los valores familiares. Crearon también el premio “Mujer Admirable” buscando hacer visibles
  los esfuerzos y talentos de la mujer latina en los Estados Unidos.
  Premio que se otorga a mujeres admirables, al igual que ella, desde
  hace más de dos décadas. Todo iba bien, pero el 14 de abril de este mismo año, Elizabeth fue
  diagnosticada con mieloma múltiple, una especie de cáncer.  Su familia
  se cimbró de miedo al enfrentar una realidad tan triste. El suelo se
  movió para ellos sin previo aviso. Elizabeth no podía enfocarse entonces solamente en buscar opciones
  de tratamientos para su enfermedad, seguía trabajando al lado de su
  esposo para sacar adelante su familia y al mismo tiempo encabezar un
  Grupo de apoyo y oración en Houston, Texas. Fue su fe, la que llevó a Elizabeth a contestarle al médico que le
  dio el diagnóstico: Yo puedo con ésto. Ni ella misma supo de donde
  salió esa repuesta. Lo que siguió fueron entradas y salidas de salas
  de emergencia, estudios pesados y dolorosos. Dolor extremo, confusión
  mental y paralización momentánea de algunas partes de su cuerpo. De ser una mujer independiente enfrentó entonces como agua helada
  al rostro, la dependencia total de su esposo Humberto; que con amor y
  paciencia se convirtió en su principal aliado. Los gastos se
  triplicaron y las ingresos no alcanzaban al no poder estar tan al
  pendiente de su negocio. Es entonces, que Todos Unidos por un solo Corazón, surge como
  iniciativa del Grupo de compañerismo y oración  guiado por Elizabeth
  Ozuna en Houston, Texas para tratar de obtener fondos y apoyarla en 
  este difícil camino para alcanzar su salud. Su cuerpo resistió 19 quimioterapias inyectadas en el estómago y
  algunas dosis de radiación tomada, antes de colapsar. Hoy, Elizabeth Ozuna se encuentra internada en el Hospital San
  Vicente de la ciudad de Monterrey, después de sobrevivir una crisis de
  meningitis provocada por la baja de defensas de su organismo
  provocadas por el mieloma múltiple. Ely lucha por su vida, aferrada a su fe, junto con el apoyo de su
  familia y amigos que le agradecemos su existencia y aprendizajes que
  nos ha dejado. Hagamos llegar a Elizabeth y Humberto Ozuna, a sus tres hijos
  nuestras oraciones y nuestro apoyo monetario para cubrir los costos
  del Hospital en Monterrey, NL. Mexico y de traslado a Houston, Texas. No hay recursos que alcancen, Hoy, Todos Unidos por un solo Corazón
  los invita a extender su mano generosa y apoyar a la familia con la
  cantidad que les sea posible o que les indique su corazón. Ely se envuelve en cada batalla en el amor de su familia y las
  promesas de DIOS. Se reviste con la palabra del Padre reflejada en el
  Salmo 91: No temerás el terror de la noche, ni la flecha que vuela de día, ni la peste que acecha en las sombras ni la plaga que destruye a mediodía. Podrán caer mil a tu izquierda, y diez mil a tu derecha, pero a ti no te afectará. Ya que has puesto al Señor por tu refugio, al Altísimo por tu protección,ningún mal habrá de sobrevenirte, ninguna calamidad llegará a tu hogar. Porque él ordenará que sus ángeles te cuiden en todos tus caminos. Con sus propias manos te levantarán para que no tropieces con piedra alguna.

"I live in a country where LGBT people are persecuted by law, and
  finding skilled doctors who are LGBT-friendly is incredibly difficult.
  Trans people in particular encounter extreme difficulties when seeking
  doctors for transitioning treatment and gender reassignment surgery. I've managed to find a doctor who's skilled and experienced at FtM
  top surgery (gender reassignment procedure for transgender men that
  creates a masculine chest), and I've been saving for a few years to be
  able to undergo the procedure. I have been informed, however, that the doctor will be retiring soon,
  and it is likely that he will decide to retire early, as early
    as next year. His colleagues and other known doctors in the country charge double
  of his fee, and he's one of the best local surgeons when it comes to
  FtM surgery. My hope is that I am able to undergo the procedure before he
    retires, and I'm aiming to get it done by January 2018. I've saved up enough to be able to pay the deposit and travelling
  costs (the doctor is based at a different state), but I cannot

"Hello! My name is Yvonne Foong, I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis type
  2 when I was 16 years old with hearing and vision damaged. It causes
  tumours to grow anywhere in my brain, along with the spinal cords and
  peripheral nerves. So far I have had 20 different surgeries to safely
  remove the tumours whenever needed to preserve my life. In the end of 2017, I need to undergo surgery again to remove
  multiple large tumours called schwannoma from both my arms. They have
  made my fingers and hands increasingly numb. If they are not carefully
  removed, they can paralyze my arms. I cannot become incapacitated, my mother will be helpless if I lose
  the ability to take care of myself. Last year, I had brain surgery at
  the US NIH, the surgery was done well. However, I was not taken cared
  of well in the ward. My vision became damaged as a result, I have had
  to adapt by getting help from people to do my work and in order to
  stay productive, while my mother started having to prepare my daily
  living needs despite her advanced age.  So I must go for surgery with
  doctors who can do better to save my arms before it is too late. Some brief details about the surgery: Where: St Vincent Medical Center, Los Angeles. By Who: Dr. Gregory P Lekovic, Neurosurgeon.

"Thank you for taking the time to visit this page in honor of Jake. 
  The Conde family is extremely grateful for each and every one of you.
    The saying "" It takes a village"" is definitely true in
  this situation. How does a family properly thank someone for the
  things that they have done to help out during difficult times?  You
  need to know how much all the prior well wishes, positive thoughts,
  prayers, donations, helping with meals, helping out with Lucas, gifts
  for Jake, time spent together, and friendship has meant to the Conde
  family - THANK YOU! Here we go again... Where do I even begin?  Honestly, it's really
  difficult to gather thoughts, considering so much has gone on the past
  77 weeks.  As most of you know, Jake was diagnosed with Ewing's
  Sarcoma in his left femur bone in April of 2015, when he was 9 years
  old. To keep it short, it was a very long year with many nights in the
  hospital, multiple biopsies, surgeries, chemo, lab/diagnostic testing,
  physical therapy etc.  It was a nightmare, but they got through it -
  or so they thought.  Shortly after his year long cancer treatment
  ended, Jake started having pain in his shoulder and losing weight, so
  they took him in for testing.  Then came the devastating news, which
  was even worse than the first time around.  Not only was his cancer
  back, they were told that Jake had 6 metastatic tumors. Cancer sucks!
  Sarcoma sucks! Many of you have emailed or left messages for Steph, Roger, and
  myself asking what you can do to help. First and foremost, for those
  of you who pray, please keep Jake in your daily prayers.  Jake has a
  birthday coming up, he turns 11 on October 22nd.  If you would like to
  send him a card or write him a note, you can mail it directly to his
  home, or contact me (my number is below) for more information. For
  those of you who would like to make a small donation, that would be
  great too. I know that they are spending thousands of dollars out of
  pocket each month. Currently Jake has had five in-patient chemo treatments (each 5 days
  long), and goes back in on Monday 10/17 for his sixth treatment.  A
  recent scan showed only 2 of his 6 tumors as active - this is good
  news!  The current plan is to give Jake 18 months of chemo - that's
  the bad news!  The chemo is taking a toll on him, the drugs are very
  hard on your body, it's been tough! In addition to chemo, the Conde family strongly believes in an
  alternative and holistic approach this time around; they believe
  that the chemo alone will not cure their son.  Jake is eating all
  organic and non-gmo foods, using essential oils, cannabis oil,
  juicing, drinking alkaline water & special teas, taking
  supplements... You name it, they're doing it! What the Conde family is going through is impossible to comprehend. 
  We've watched Jake go from being such a happy, funny, spirited
  child who was so full of life, to fighting for his life. What are the
  days during chemo and just after chemo like for them now?  At times
  Jake is screaming/crying in pain, has anxiety/fear of upcoming
  procedures/testing, vomits throughout the day, spends most of the day
  on the couch or in bed with no energy, is up sick most of the night,
  feels depressed, angry, and lonely at times. It stinks! It's really
  tough to see him/them go through this!  Roger and Steph are up around
  the clock caring for Jake, it's 24/7!  But, they continue to stay
  strong, believe in miracles, and have hope!  Losing is not an option! During Jake's first year of treatment Jake watched a lot of Adam
  Sandler movies in the hospital, Stephanie and Roger expressed how
  those movies helped them get through the awful hospital stays. 
  Laughter soothes the soul!  If you have any really good funny movie
  suggestions that are appropriate for an 11 year old, please make suggestions. The best therapy for Jake and family right now is for them to get out
  of the house (when Jake is feeling well), or to have company; they
  love to be around friends and family every chance they get. Even if
  it's for a short time.  Don't be afraid to reach out! We are all thankful for every minute, hour or glimpse of happiness
  that Jake feels. When he smiles, we all smile! Thank you for your concern and continued support.

"For those of you that don't know me or know me well, three
      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this
        treatment. Protection of my girls, wisdom and patience for my
        husband, strength and peace for my mom, travel mercies,
        successful treatment, eradicating the cancer are just a few of
        the prayer requests I would ask of you. Thank you in advance for
        joining me in prayer. It is our most powerful weapon against the darkness. Psalm 46:1-7 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.[c] 4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 7 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . **NOTICE** King's College London will be closed for the
    holidays from December 23rd, 2017 to January 8th, 2018. Orders made
    during this time will be shipped out when the campus reopens on
    January 9th, 2018. Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within two weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
  sample to us, the samples will be processed and analysed by the Knight
  Lab at University of California, San Diego and you will be provided
  with a list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and the
  proportions in which they are found. We estimate that this will take
  around 3 months (but possibly longer) and once we provide you with
  your results, you will be able to see how your bacterial community
  compares to others in the study. From the diet and lifestyle
  information that you provide, we will also be able to show you how
  your results compare to other people who are within the same diet and
  lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to them
  does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you have
  experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your bacterial
  profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"HOW IT ALL STARTED AND THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS My husband, Poh Teik “Jack” Teoh, age 63, was diagnosed with
    Stage 4 skin cancer in September 2017.  The cancer has spread to his
    spine and ribs and has severely weakened his body in ways that are
    distressing and heart-breaking for us both. The cancer started out as a very small growth on Jack’s right
    ear. It was initially diagnosed as a fungus infection and treated
    successfully with anti-fungal medication in the USA in the spring of
    2015.  In November of 2015, with great health and high expectations,
    we decided to follow our ultimate dream and set-up an import/export
    business in Penang, Malaysia; my husband’s birthplace. In Malaysia, the growth on Jack’s ear
    gradually came back so we sought medical help. The first doctor
    diagnosed the growth as cancerous. He recommended amputating the
    whole ear and scraping off the brain tissue surrounding the ear
    followed by plastic surgery to make a new ear.  We immediately
    sought a second opinion as the growth was very small. To us and many
    others this surgical solution was too severe and Jack’s overall
    health was excellent. The second doctor recommended a series of
    stronger medications including chemo pills. We followed this
    treatment and managed to keep the growth under control. We expected
    the growth would vanish just as it did in the USA In early 2017 my husband started to
    feel weak off and on with intermittent and sometimes indescribable
    pain. Jack managed to control the pain with prescribed medication
    and his own sheer will. We continued to work very hard at full speed
    to launch our import business, putting in our best effort with full
    enthusiasm to make our dreams come true.  Then in August, Jack
    suddenly became extremely weak, he lost his appetite completely and
    the growth started to spread at an alarming rate.   That’s when I
    admitted Jack into Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital here in Penang,
    Malaysia; an excellent hospital with a phenomenal medical staff. I
    moved into Jack’s hospital room the day he was admitted and have not
    left his side since. For the full medical diagnosis see the letter written by
      Jack’s doctor (Dr. Ho) below: THE REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF THE COME-BACK KID – THE FIRST 2
      MONTHS AT MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Due to the excellent care at Mount Miriam Cancer
    Hospital, in addition to Jack’s inimitable strength and fighting
    spirit, Jack has been able to consistently beat all odds and triumph
    over some very serious health issues. In early September, a few days
    after his first chemo infusion, he suffered a heart attack.
    Amazingly, Jack recovered and prevailed with willingness and
    strength. Just three weeks after his heart attack, Jack decided to
    continue the chemo (in a more gentler form) to resume his fight
    against his cancer. Due to a rapid loss of muscle mass and strength since August,
    Jack no longer has the strength to stand up on his own. He can only
    walk a short distance in our hospital room with a walker and the
    assistance of a therapist.  My husband is bound to the bed most of
    the time. He barely has enough strength to practice learning how to
    walk again.  But despite the severity of Jack’s condition, and the
    utter frustration he endures, he never fails to inspire others, make
    the doctors and nurses smile as they admire his remarkable strength
    and positivity. After the 4th chemo infusion on October 25th, Jack developed
    an infection that hit him fast and fierce. His oxygen levels dropped
    dramatically and he had extreme difficulty breathing. He was headed
    for the Intensive Care Unit at another hospital but thankfully the
    medical staff at Mount Miriam got the infection under control
    quickly and stabilized Jack beautifully.  Jack took a brief break
    from the chemo and agreed to resume the treatments on November 10th.
    As Jack said: “there is more positive than negative” and he chooses
    to continue what’s working for him and face every battle head-on. Dr. Ho & Jack Medical Attention ELLEN & JACK: MEANT TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER Born in the USA, I grew up Mountain
    Lakes, New Jersey and my husband Jack is from Malaysia.  We met in
    New Jersey in 2003 when Jack was living and working in New York. 
    From the very first day I met Jack he was always robust and full of
    life. He woke up every morning like it was Christmas, just like a
    child.  Jack is like a magnet, he’s irresistible, pulling people in
    with his charisma and zany sense of humour.  But what stole my heart
    is his heart. I have never met a person as self-less as my husband.
    He is someone I can trust with all my heart to do the right thing
    for anyone in any situation. Jack is a leader with a big heart; some
    would say a true warrior.  It’s absolutely heart-wrenching for me to
    see my husband suffer and become so weak and frail in such a short
    period of time.  He has spent a lifetime generously helping others
    and now is in great need himself.  I ask you to please help me help
    my husband, so he can beat this cancer and we can continue our lives
    as one.  This journey of recovery and healing will take time, but we
    both have a deep, enduring faith that we will prevail with the
    continuation of the excellent medical care at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital. Jack and me 2005 HELP NEEDED:  MEDICAL AND BASIC LIVING EXPENSES Due to the onset of Jack’s illness,
    the launching of our business was cut short, so we are not
    generating any income.  Due to my husband’s fragile and
    unpredictable condition, I am with him around the clock to make sure
    his special needs are met. I give him the peace of mind that I will
    never leave his side and the assurance he will always be safe.  With
    neither one of us working, continuing to pay for Jack’s medical
    expenses and our living expenses is an impossibility without the
    help of others. Not having medical insurance, we have received some
    financial help from the hospital’s social welfare department.
    However, it’s not enough and I am not sure if it will continue. We
    have monthly expenses in the USA that also add to our financial
    burden.  Witnessing my husband go through periods of anguish and
    taking care of him can be very stressful and exhausting. With your
    kind consideration and help, our financial stress can be alleviated.
    Your generosity would allow me to brave this journey with less
    pressure and more strength to support my husband with his medical
    and personal needs. Your financial help, and the spreading of my
    campaign on your social network, will be forever appreciated because
    I simply cannot do this alone.  Thank you ever so much. BREAKDOWN OF MONTHLY EXPENSES I NEED HELP WITH WHILE JACK IS HOSPITLALIZED Monthly Medical at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital: average of
      $7205.50 USD $8,451.00 USD (Sept) $5,960.00 USD (Oct) Monthly Malaysian Living Expenses (rent, utilities,
    internet/phones, transportation, food) :  $1,065.00 USD Monthly Upkeep of USA bills (car insurance, car
    loan, credit cards and storage space) :  $1,120.00 USD It’s very difficult to determine when
    Jack will be discharged and continue his treatments as an
    out-patient either from home or a step-down facility.  Just when it
    looks like a discharge is nearing, he has another set-back that
    requires intensive hospital care.  With more chemo on the way, I
    just don’t know what to expect and how his body will respond. We
    take it week by week, day by day. Jack started a 12-week course of chemo on September 29th.
    After he finished his 4th infusion on October 20th he had a set-back
    due to a serious infection but resumed his infusions on November
    10th. He recently finished his 6th chemo but is taking a break to
    garner some strength and a better appetite before he does the 7th
    chemo.  After this 12-week course is finished, there will be a
    reassessment and break before the next chemo course starts.  Then,
    after 6 months of chemo infusions there will be another reassessment
    to determine the next phase of treatment, which may include radiation. At this point in time, it’s impossible to determine our
    medical and living expenses after discharge. It all depends on how
    stable and self-sufficient Jack is at that time. I do know that it
    will take some time, months, for him to regain the strength
    necessary to walk on his own again.  If Jack is not re-admitted into
    the hospital, we will be looking at the following expenses. This is the best approximation I can give at this time: EXPENSES AFTER DISCHARGE FROM MOUNT MIRIAM CANCER HOSPITAL Live-in, Step-down Facility with Medical Care and Physical
    Therapy:   $1,125.00 USD per month (a step-down facility if
  necessary, or Jack can do his out-patient from home ) Monthly Malaysian Living Expenses when Living at Home (rent, utilities, internet/phones, transportation,
    food): $1,215.00 USD Monthly upkeep of USA bills (car insurance, car
  loan, credit cards and storage space) :  $1,120.00 USD Basic Medical Supplies Needed at Home:  $436.00 USD
  min (wheelchair, walker, commode, air cushion mattress) Monthly Physical Therapy & Visiting Nurse at Home: 
    $705.00 USD Monthly Out-Patient Expenses at Mount Miriam Hospital: approximate range of $1,143.00 to $2,755.00
  USD (doctor appointments, blood tests, chemo infusions,
  blood transfusions, ear dressings, medications) Radiation:  $2,000 USD (one time charge) When a donation is made, the money will be accepted by PayPal
    and then deposited into my USA bank checking account.  With my USA
    checking account debit card, I can pay for Jack’s medical expenses
    here at Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital.  From my Malaysian bank, I can
    also withdraw cash (in the form of Malaysian Ringgits) from my USA
    checking account and this will allow me to pay for our apartment
    rent, utilities, food and transportation expenses.  I can also pay
    my USA debts directly from USA checking account. The following fees are deducted from each donation (USA &
    Canada): Fundrazr : 5% PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30 Total
    deducted from each donation:  7.9% + $0.30 International fees:  Fundrazr 5%  &  PayPal 4.3% to 4.5% + $0.30 Calling on all Angels with a giving
    heart. Due to my desperate situation, this is the first time I have
    ever done a fundraiser.  As my social network is small, I would
    greatly appreciate your help in sharing my campaign.  I just do not
    know what lies ahead in medical expenses, it’s very hard to predict.
    The hospital has been understanding of my financial situation but
    does expect a significant payment every 2 to 3 weeks. I greatly appreciate your kind consideration in supporting me
    & donating to the best of your ability in this critical
    situation.  Thank you all so very much. With Great Appreciation & Love, Ellen","5,605",of $125k goal,https://fundrazr.com/HelpEllenSupportJack,Bridge Over Troubled Water for Jack,28,,U.S. Dollar

"I'm Steph. The beautiful boy in the photo is my son, Ethan. He suffers from severe Cavus Foot, which means his arch is so high
  that he literally walks on the very tips of his toes. In addition he
  has scoliosis, which means his spine curves to the side. He cannot ride a bike. He can barely balance when he wears his book
  bag. Stairs are a death sentence. His lower back is in constant pain.
  I have kept him home from school at least 10 days due to
  severe cramps in his legs and feet. He is also an aspy (has asperger's). Though I think this makes him
  THE MOST amazing person I have EVER know, others, unfortunately, will
  not even give him a chance to show them. He has been constantly
  bullied since the 2nd grade and has always hurt him so much because he
  really does love people and gets so upset with himself because he
  doesn't know how to talk to people without them thinking he is ""a
  weirdo"". This breaks my heart in half. So imagine the way he is
  treated by his peers when you combine his social
  ""awkwardness"" with his feet problems. I can assure you that
  the worst things you think kids say and do are ten times less awful
  then what kids really say and do to him. To give you an understanding of how much my son feels for others,
  I'll give you this one quick example of countless instances like it... I was called to pick him up from school one day because he was sick.
  When I got there, I went to the nurse's office and he just started
  crying. I asked ""what hurts?! Do we need to go to the
  hospital!?"" He replied, ""No mom, I just feel really bad that
  you had to leave work and pay for a cab ride all the way here to pick
  me up."" He is unbelievably compassionate and empathetic and for those who
  know others on the spectrum, you know they tend to have
  hypersensitivity to some or all senses. Ethan is hypersensitive to sound and emotion. He wants to make
  everyone happy and it hurts him so much when he thinks he causes any
  kind of stress, pain or disappointment, even when he is sick or hurt. So, yes, he is so sad. And I would never do anything about his way of
  thinking, even if I could, because he is so awesome, but, with your
  help, I can help him with his only other wish. He wants to be able to walk into his first day of high school, like
  the rest of the kids. He wants to run and ride his bike and walk home
  from school without someone calling him twinkle toes or pterodactyl. After months of doctor visits to his neurologist, neurosurgeon,
  orthopedic surgeon, EMT test, 2 MRIs and x-rays, We will finally see
  his orthopedic surgeon next week to set a date for his surgery. The surgery will consist of the cutting and extension of multiple
  tendons in his arch and achelles, the largest being a heel extension
  over 2' long. He will also have tendons removed from some parts of his
  feet and legs, then placed into other areas of tension. He will have
  incisions around calves and just below the knee, as well as larger
  incisions above the knees around his quads and hamstrings. If his full MRI results show that his spinal cord is not tethered, he
  will not have to have surgery on his back, but will have to wear a
  back brace until he is 16 years old for at least 20 hours per day. I cannot work, as he will have all surgery at once and will be nearly
  immobile for 8-10 weeks (at the very least). Once his casts come off,
  he will need extensive and extremely frequent physical therapy for a
  long time. Full recover will be at least one year. His insurance will hopefully cover most of the surgery, but will not
  cover anything else. Bills, food, simple things like soap and toilet paper. Anything you can donate is more appreciated than you can imagine, as
  I am his mother and I want what is best for him. Unfortunately I
  cannot do this alone. With that, I am swallowing my pride and asking for your help. Thank you so much for your love and support. Love, Steph","1,837",of $4k goal,https://fundrazr.com/give4ethan,We Need Your Help!,45,,U.S. Dollar

"My name is Molly Hernandez Avellan, I am a 26-year-old resident
    of Hillsborough, NJ and I am blessed to say that I have married into
    one of the most generous, loving and selfless families on the
    planet. It is exactly for this reason that I am reaching out to all
    of you, my friends, relatives, co-workers and generous strangers to
    help support a member of my family. A 3-year-old boy named Andy. Andy was born on June 18, 2013 with polysyndactyly, resulting in
    extreme deformation of his four limbs, and numerous other health complications. As a three-year-old, Andy has already undergone five, and is
      now on his sixth surgery: Three in his hands, one in his
    foot, one in his testicle, one to amputate the first of both feet,
    with more to come. During his first surgery on September 9, 2013, doctors
        were able to separate the fused bones in his hand and create
        three individual fingers. The second surgery on April 26, 2014, Andy
      had both feet operated on, only to have complications
        during the procedure impair any progress. The third surgery on February 20, 2014 sought
      to operate the undescended testicle. The fourth surgery on April 15, 2015 removed extra
        bones from his hands. The fifth surgery to date was on October 1, 2015, where his
        hands were finally separated into five fingers. The sixth and
          most recent surgery took place, September 8th, to remove the
          first of both of his feet. Though these are huge strides, the follow-up and treatment plan
    to address Andy’s severely deformed and clubbed feet has become
    extremely complex and thus far, surgically unsuccessful to
    physicians from the National Children’s Hospital of Costa Rica.
    Andy’s amazing team of doctors has worked with other physicians from
    The United States, Mexico and Argentina without any success due to
    the complexity, peculiarity and severity of Andy’s case. Fortunately, on June 21, 2016, orthopedic surgeons from France
    arrived to the National Children’s Hospital. These specialists evaluated and
        examined Andy’s feet and concluded that the best option is to amputate below his ankles so
        that Andy would be able to walk in the future with the aid of prosthesis. Andy was slated to undergo his
      first amputation in December 2016, however, he was able to be
      moved up and is had his first amputation on September 8th, 2016. This surgical procedure will
      amputate the right foot. After his recovery, they will proceed to
      amputate the left foot. From that point moving
    forward, Andy will require prosthetic legs. However, Andy will grow out of the
          prosthetics every 12 months, requiring a new pair every year
          until growth has halted. The cost of the prosthetics is high, but Andy will be able
      to walk, run, and jump like a normal child. This little boy
      deserves the chance to live a normal childhood just like other
      boys his age, not worry if he will ever be able to walk. Please,

  I'll be running my first ultra marathon, a 32 miles race around Bolton
  Abbey, Skipton. https://racebest.com/races/bolton-abbey-trail-running-festival I'm doing this for a great cause; to help raise money to fund the
  cancer treatment for my cousin Rachel. After the birth of her second baby Rachel repeatedly went to her
    GP with back pain; for 7 months she was told it was muscular and to
    take paracetamol. After 3 trips to A&E with pain a locum GP
    advised scans. The scans showed a tumour in the pancreas and bile
    ducts, a biopsy confirmed it was cancerous and inoperable, only
    palliative treatment could be offered in the UK. Rachel could have taken the word of the oncologist as being
    absolute; she could have listened to specialist nurses who advised
    accepting that there was nothing more to do. She didn’t, and with
    the help of family (in particular her middle sister Jayne)
    researched every possible treatment and alternative. The results of
    the research found effective treatments available in other countries. Rachel Underwent a new type of treatment in Germany which has
    been funded by her parents. Even at an early stage blood results
    showed the tumour was shrinking and moving away from neighbouring
    vital organs and to everyone's amazement after a year the tumour had
    no active cancer in it and was basically just scar tissue. Another year on and the cancer was back, it had spread to
    her lymph nodes, she had ascites in her abdomen and Rachel
    began preparing to fight again. Her children are one year older,
    Freya has just started in reception at primary School and Will has
    moved up a class in Nursery, they are such amazing kids and it
    breaks my heart that they have to go through this again. Again the NHS can offer no treatment, except palliative care.

    they will be able to help Rachel, by offering a new type of
    treatment called Immunotherapy. Unfortunately, this time there is
    not enough money left after paying for previous treatments, and

  care at the center which included: neglect from nursing staff, in which he had to call admin for help leaving him unattended in a wheelchair with his legs left down,
    causing immense swelling and wounds worsening twice a day dressings were not done and even worse, the wounds
    left unwrapped, a critical error that could invite infection and the doctor changed Larry's regular medications that had taken
    months for his regular doctor to find the right dosage/medication types. With twice daily wound dressings, and 2 x week home health care,
  Larry has received 24/7 care from his wife for the last 7 months. On top of dealing with healing the burn wounds and recovering from
  the medication mistakes at rehab, a backward fall from his wheelchair,
  a kidney stone, and dangerously low blood pressure and borderline
  sepsis landed him in the hospital every week for over one month. Larry had been through so much medically that he and his wife
  wondered if his body could make it through the healing and if he'd
  ever walk again. The first diagnoses ranged from him losing both of his feet or maybe
  a few toes, two or more years in wound care treatment, and possible
  skin grafts for one or both feet. However, to promote healing, he wasn't allowed to put any weight
    on either foot, which made daily living a real challenge. He needed complete assistance because he couldn't stand, lean, walk,
  or put any weight on his feet. Larry needed help to transfer from his recliner to wheelchair,
  transfer to their SUV for doctor appointments, and help into the
  bathroom and to shower. It was difficult because while he physically had his legs, it was
  almost as if he had both amputated because he wasn't allowed to put
  any pressure on his feet. Larry worked on ways to transfer into the car safely and to help his
  wife as much as he could since his not walking added more physical
  challenges to her chronic health issues. They didn't have medical equipment when he first arrived home from
  the rehab center, so Larry improvised and created his own. The burns also complicated his overall health as the new treatment
  changed his regular medications and added others --- his regular
  health treatments that had been going well in the prior months. Thank God, Larry did not lose his feet or legs. With his heart problems and other chronic health conditions, it's a
  miracle he didn't die. Although neither Larry or his wife could predict how this latest
  challenge would affect his overall quality of life. After 6 months, with wounds healing but not gone, he was finally
  approved for limited standing and walking. Physical therapy started, and though it was painful, he didn't give up. Both Larry and Jennifer were overjoyed at seeing him stand and
    take small steps , however wobbly. They hadn't been sure
  he'd ever be in a standing or walking position again. It was a godsend. Though it had been a hard road financially and physically on their
  family, in December 2016, doctors were amazed at the burn
    wound progress and thought he may only need skin grafts for one foot. And the skin grafts were a maybe, not a definite need. The
    news seemed like another miracle in his healing. And then a week before Christmas 2016, he still had one wound
    that hadn't healed for three months, and other wounds unexpectedly
    worsened. His limited walking ability, even with physical therapy to help
  strengthen his muscles, became worse. He was very unstable
    standing and walking, falling, and in extreme pain. Of course, everyone thought the problems walking was simply because
  he had been non-weight-bearing for 6 months. But it didn't make sense
  that he was doing worse as time went on. After visiting his primary and several specialists, he was referred
  by his heart study nurse to another cardiac doctor. He also fell
  before surgery and scraped his shin, which turned into a huge wound. This doctor performed an exploratory surgery with the possibility of
  fixing any artery blockages. It turned out he couldn't fix the
  blockages during that time because Larry had 100 percent blockages in
  all arteries in both legs. Because of the area affected, from the knees to the feet, the doctor
  thought the cause may be part of the lightning strike combined with
  chronic health conditions. The doctor's recommendation was two or three more surgeries to
    help open the blockages, though he cautioned the surgeries would be tricky. Rev. Larry had the first surgery, which the doctor called a partial
  success since he could only unblock one artery; one is partially
  blocked; the third remains 100 percent blocked. Larry suffered some complications during and after the surgery. Any surgery seems to complicate his other chronic conditions, and he
  has to be pre-treated because of allergy to the contrast dye necessary
  in the surgery, some of his regular meds have to temporarily stop, and
  the medications to treat the allergy skyrocket his blood sugar for days. The good news is the partial success of this first surgery is
    already showing some improvement in his steadiness and help in
    healing his leg and foot wounds! Seeing these small improvements so quickly after this first
    surgery has rekindled our family's hope. The treatment plan is 2 to 3 more surgeries over the next 8 to
    12 weeks. The doctor thinks these surgeries will greatly improve his
    total wound healing, increase his ability to walk, and reduce his
    overall pain. Why they need your help: His wife Jennifer works part-time from home to take care of Larry
  since his stroke and heart issues require 24-hour care. But she also
  works part time from home because of her own chronic health
  conditions, including Fibromyalgia. Her main work project ended earlier than expected, in mid-December,
  and her health issues flared shortly afterward. They received
  emergency financial help from family, but since they were living
  paycheck to paycheck, they quickly became behind on regular living expenses. In caring for Larry over the last 7 months, Jennifer has dealt
    with her own increased health problems in addition to the
  Fibromyalgia : diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, sprained her
  hand, fallen twice (one recently in which she hurt her ankle, broke
  her phone, and broke her glasses), became severely ill with digestive
  issues that built up toxins in her body, and had a wisdom tooth and
  another one extracted. Larry's upcoming surgeries and recovery time combined with Jennifer's
  health issues will not only limit her work availability but also add
  additional expenses. Items they'll need financial help with: additional medications for both Larry and Jennifer medical supplies for Larry's wounds a car part that broke down the day before Larry's last surgery new shoes for Larry to help in his walking recliner for Larry as the current one is broken but still being used new replacement glasses for Jennifer other items not covered by insurance but will help Larry's
    recovery to walk again and help Jennifer regain her health and
    remain a caregiver. As Larry's treatment continues, there may be other recommendations
  from his doctor. Since they were already behind on their regular bills, which they
  reduced as much as possible prior to the accident, they are in an
  overwhelming situation. Add additional medical bills and unexpected
  bills, and it's near impossible to cover everything themselves. Their regular living expenses include: Rent Water Car insurance Medical co-pays Electricity Internet service Phone Gas Food For Larry's safety and recovery time, this new treatment plan
    is expected for the next 3 to 4 months. It is not easy to ask others for help. Rev. Larry and Jennifer wanted to take care of all their needs by
  themselves, but with the additional expenses, reduced income, and
  increased medical issues, they can't do this alone. They need help from their friends. Please share their fundraising page to help spread the word. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.",515,of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/31Clle,Help Rev. Larry Walk After Lightning Strike,13,,U.S. Dollar

"Hi Everyone, My amazing brother Paddy and his equally amazing colleagues Cariosa
  and Brenda are running the Connemara half marathon on April 10th to
  raise funds for my short follow up trip back to the USA! I've made
  huge progress thanks to the €14K that I raised here before, when I was
  originally heading out to the USA. So we are using this page again to
  help raise some badly needed funds to keep the health improvements
  going, so that I can continue to help spread the word on Lyme Disease
  in Ireland and prevent others from falling prey to the same fate. I can't tell you how grateful I am to Paddy, Cariosa and Brenda for
  the months of hard work and training they have put into this. I'm
  working with the event organisers to try and use this opportunity to
  raise awareness of Lyme among joggers, who are a very high risk group.
  There are 3,000 runners in this years event. Even if we got through to
  a third of them that's still 1,000 people, who will hopefully spread
  the word on Lyme futher out into the community! Everyone who sponsors
  the guys will be entered into a draw for a 3 day camping pitch pass
  for a family of 4 which also includes a 1 day family pass to the
  Pirate Adventure Park! The draw will take place on the 7th of May. Since I set up my awareness raising campaign at www.elainefightslyme.com and on my facebook page
  Elaine Fights Lyme I have managed secure a 33% reduction on testing
  costs with the leading European Tick Borne Diseases laboratory, for
  anyone who believes they may be infected. I have helped countless
  individuals to access testing and understand more about Lyme Disease
  and directed them towards treatment options for themselves and
  sometimes their families. I'm receiving contact from people directly
  on a weekly basis since I started up. Some of there stories have been
  just devastating and not unlike my own, which is detailed below. Apart from appearing frequently on national and local radio and print
  media this past 18 months, I was invited as a guest speaker to the
  Suffering The Silence Conference in London in October 2015, where I
  gave a talk entitled ""The Role of Creativity in Chronic
  Illness"", available to read on the Elaine Fights Lyme Facebook
  Page. I was a nominee this year for the Most Inspirational Women of
  the Year Award for Mayo 2015, for all of my on going work on
  continuing to raise awareness on Lyme Disease.  I have collborated
  with MSD Animal Health Care and am currently very excited to be
  teaming up with the Leave No Trace environmental group to help gain
  access to those working and recreating in the great outdoors, so that
  I can help them to better protect themselves. I've written an article
  for the latest edition of their e-newsletter and I've just completed
  an awareness training session with them this week, with lots more
  follow on to happen soon! I was recently invited to speak at the Soroptomist Ireland organised
  event to celebrate International Womens Day 2016 and I'm continuing to
  seek out as many opportunites as possible to keep raising the profile
  on Lyme on this Island. The treatment I have undergone these past 18 months has been utterly
  gruelling at times. The treatment for Lyme is sometimes worse than the
  symptoms and the dying bacteria poison your system, but for the first
  time in my life I am seeing and feeling progress and I can't tell you
  how amazing that feels! Lyme is here. It's not going to go away, so we need to learn to live
  with it with awareness and know how to protect ourselves and our loved
  ones from this potentially life threatening and utterly debilitating
  disease. Any little bit of sponsorship you can give to the joggers
  would be so gratefully received and directed completely towards my
  treatment and awareness raising fund. The better I get, the more
  awareness raising I can do and the more hope I can give to others who
  are suffering with this horrendous diease, Thanks so much, stay tick saavy this coming spring and summer, Elaine X Hi Everyone, My name is Elaine Griffin and I am a 42 year old artist and musician
  living in Westport, Co. Mayo, Ireland. I am also a part-time lecturer
  at the National College of Art & Design, Dublin, Ireland. For
  those of you who know me well, you will know that I have been
  struggling with Chronic Health issues for the last 24 years, since I
  was 18 years old, so pretty much all of my adult life. My relentless
  search for answers to the cause of my debilitating, unremitting pain,
  physical discomfort and exhaustion have, over the last 10 years alone
  brought me around the globe, having received treatment from Ireland,
  Australia, India, Germany and the UK and I’ve spent close on €150,000
  in the process. So, it was heartbreaking for me to finally be properly
  diagnosed by a spealist laboratory in Germany, last November, with
  Chronic Lyme Disease and 8 other bacterial tick borne co-infections. There is a very poor understanding of this disease in Ireland and
  consequentally there is very limited treatment options available,
  although the HSE did finally come out this year warning of the
  presence of Lyme Disease here, which is transmitted by a tick bite, so
  that is a start. I initated treatment with the leading European Lyme
  and Tick Borne disease clinic, the BCA in Germany last December, but
  due to length of time left undiagnosed, which has resulted in multiple
  system problems in my body, coupled with some profoundly mutated
  genetics, they were not able to deal with me and I am now forced to
  seek treatment in the USA, as these are the only people who have the
  knowledge and experience to manage my very complex case. As you can
  imagine the cost of this medical treatment in America is enormous, and
  this is why I need your help. Lyme disease, caused by the spirochetal bacteria Borrelia
  Burgdorferi, can manifest symptoms in every single body system. It
  attacks the connective tissues throughout organs systems, the blood,
  skeletal and muscular systems and the central nervous system, wreaking
  havoc on the entire functioning of the human body. In the last 10
  years alone I have been diagnosed with palindromic rheumatism,
  fibromyalgia, macrocytic anemia, adrenal insufficency, thyroid hormone
  resistence, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Myalgia Encephalomyalitis,
  persistent high grade cervical dysplasia, depression, anxiety
  disorder, PTSD, carpel tunnel syndrome, TMJ, recurrent sciatica,
  irritable bowel syndrome and the list goes on and on. I have suffered
  from chronic lead and multiple metal poisoning as a result of my
  faulty genetics and the supression of my immune system, due to the
  massive bacterial load I am carrying. My immune system is shot - I
  have had shingles flare-ups 8 times since last December alone. I have
  lost track of the consultants and practicioners I have seen in the
  last 10 years,  but it is at least 30 across the globe, all of whom
  acknowledged that there was something going on but never finding the
  ultimate cause. In all of this time I have had to keep working to pay my medical
  bills and have hardly missed a day at work, despite the extreme
  physical dysfunction I experience on a non-stop basis. I have been
  granted a year’s sick leave from work, so NOW is my time to try and
  get on top of this horrible disease. As the condition is not properly
  recognised here, my health insurance will not cover any of the
  astronomical costs required to get this disease under control. I need
  to get well again so that I can use my creativity to help raise
  awareness of this disease and get back to my studies as a Naturopath
  & Medical Herbalist so that I can help other sufferers to manage
  it. I don’t want anyone to ever have to go through what I have and
  awareness and prevention are the only way forward. I am a fiercly independent woman and I had dearly hoped to not have
  to do this type of fundraising, but despite all my best efforts I am
  still €10,000 short of the €30,000 for the treatment I urgently need,
  which is set to begin in the USA on the 14th of October. Please don’t feel obliged to make a donation, but if you feel moved
  to do so and are in a position to help, no matter how small, every
  single euro would mean the world to me right now. You can also help by
  organising your own event for my fundraising campaign, like a
  sponsered walk/run or golf match or by sharing this link with others
  who might know me or be in a position to help through your social

  ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD, PLEASE USE THIS PAGE, THANK YOU XXX Here is a message from Salome: Buckle Up! I'm sure that's what Dr Eagles whispered as I
    walked all shocked and in disbelief from his office. He had just
    told me that at the ripe old age of 38 I have both Rectal and Colon
    Cancer. An aggressive tumor that can drastically change my future, 4
    cm into my rectum, and a slightly less aggressive tumor in my Colon
    15cm in. I had no idea how fast everything would happen after that. By then I already knew that my Medical Aid had rejected my
    Sigmoidoscopy procedure that led to the discovery of my tumors. They
    said no as they see it as a""pre-existing"" medical
    condition. ""Cancer does not develop overnight Mrs Pope"".
    This is a complete pain in the ass (No pun intended) but I have to
    add in their defense that I had only joined their aid two months
    prior. I was immediately referred to Dr Zietsman, the best oncologist
    in Namibia, who had arranged within days for me to start my Glow in
    the Dark Radiation Therapy together with Chemo (in tablet form).
    This takes place every day for 5 to 6 weeks with a break over the
    weekends to let me body rest. We will then have an Operation to see
    how much of the Bad Boy Rectum tumor we can remove. Then continue
    with another 4 months of stronger chemo which has been upgraded to 6
    months of a much stronger chemo due to further secondary cancer
    spreads in my right lung and also my liver which were detected only
    last week. The support from my family and friends is unbelievable. My
    mother and father have been wonderfully positive and reassuring me
    without worry that everything will be ok financially. It is really
    difficult for me as my parents, now retired and pensioners, are
    willing to spend all their hard earned savings and pension money on
    my medical bills. Their loving daughter who they adore so much will
    bleed them dry financially. But then my brother and very dear friends decided that they
    will start campaigning for donations. I have been overwhelmed by
    this gesture and I am extremely grateful for what has been done and
    the donations received so far. For those people who donated
    anonymously and who I haven't been able to personally thank - Thank
    you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you Russel and Mark, my
    brother Johan, my mum Minnie and my Dad Johan, Bernidine and all
    other of my friends involved that I'm not even aware off. You guys
    are fantastic! You are making my sleepless nights worry less and
    less of a problem. Thanks to everyone that has offered to drive me
    to hospital and keep me company. Thanks to everyone who has offered
    to send me stuff like creams and lotions and whatever I need. Also
    thank you to everyone that has called or sent a message of love and
    hope. I remain positve that I will kick this disease to kingdom
    come. Every single message keeps my spirits uplifted as it shows me
    how much I'm loved. You can also email me on salomepope@googlemail.com. I may not
    be able to respond immediately but please bear with me and I will
    reply. Blessings to everyone and only good thoughts to all. I'm
    blessed to have you walk with me on this journey. xxxxxx","3,965",of £5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/613ix4,Salome's fight to beat Cancer,30,,Pound Sterling

  Rico.  Sus familiares están buscando apoyo para la niña ya que ella
  sufre de una severa condición diagnosticada por sus médicos. 
  Damayanty y su familia son de escasos recursos económicos y su
  tratamiento médico se ha visto limitado por falta de recursos
  financieros.  Actualmente la niña es tratada en La Clínica de la
  Escuela de Medicina, Recinto de Ciencias Médicas, Universidad de
  Puerto Rico. Damayanty fue diagnosticada con “Atopic dermatitis / submental
  lymphadenopathy”, una enfermedad crónica de la piel. La palabra
  “dermatitis” significa hinchazón de la piel. “Atópica” se refiere a
  una tendencia a desarrollar condiciones alérgicas de la piel.  Los
  síntomas más comunes de la dermatitis atópica son: piel reseca y
  comezón, erupciones en el cutis y en la piel detrás de las rodillas,
  en las manos y los pies y en el área interior de los codos.  El
  rascarse la piel puede causarle: enrojecimiento, hinchazón, rajaduras,
  secreciones de líquido claro, costras, piel gruesa, escamas. La niña también padece de asthma y rhinitis alérgica.  Sus médicos
  recomiendan un tratamiento especial que conlleva un cambio
  nutricional, una suplementación alimentaria y un cambio de higiene con
  productos 100% naturales que provoquen que el sistema inmune aporte y
  que la piel absorba y se ayude a regenerar. El protocolo que se estará utilizando para la niñita Damayanty y el

"Hi, my name is Catherine and I have a rare life-threatening bone
  marrow condition called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (aka MDS) and am
  looking for help to fund an experimental treatment, FMT, aimed at
  improving gut function. I became ill around 2011, with months of fatigue, dizziness,
  spontaneous bruising and frequent infections. I was found to be
  severely anaemic and eventually diagnosed with ""idiopathic""
  (ie no known cause) MDS. Blood transfusions saved my life, and I
  cannot praise our wonderful NHS staff enough. https://www.macmillan.org.uk/information-and-support/blood-cancer/blood-disorders-neoplasms/myelodysplastic-syndromes.html Until then my health had been generally good, with one exception:
  chronic gut problems, diagnosed by a gastroenterologist as Bile Acid
  Malabsorption. I will spare the embarassing details, suffice to say it
  has ruled my life for 20+ years - further info here if needed: http://www.uhcw.nhs.uk/bam/what-is-bam I am one of a lucky subgroup of MDS patients whose haemoglobin (red
  cell count) initially responded well to treatment with a supplement
  called Menatetrenone, a form of vitamin K which underwent clinical
  trials in Japan. The original research paper is here: http://www.nature.com/leu/journal/v14/n6/full/2401790a.html Having trained in nutrition I knew that this nutrient can be knocked
  out by bowel dysfunction, so suspected there was a link between the
  BAM and the MDS. This treatment improved the anaemia and kept me out
  of the danger zone for the last 4 years, however I have always known
  that it was not addressing the root cause of the problem, and there
  were obviously other factors involved. There are a number of scientific papers which note an association
  between MDS and gut issues, and recent research into Bile Acid
  Malabsorption suggests it may be caused by disturbances in gut
  bacteria (aka the microbiome): http://www.hindawi.com/journals/grp/2015/398585 So.. could restoring the microbiome to a healthy state
      cure the BAM and allow my immune system and bone marrow to start
      functioning normally? In the absence of any other answers, I would like to
  put this theory to the test. But I need financial help to do this! There is a new treatment available, which has had a very good success
  rate with a range of gut disorders from C-Diff to Crohns and IBS. The
  procedure is known as Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT), and involves
  implanting gut bacteria from a carefully screened healthy donor,
  directly into the bowel of the sick person. Yes it sounds a bit
  ""ick"", but actually the procedure is very safe and nowadays
  just involves implanting the friendly bugs, nothing else! There is growing evidence that manipulating this microbiota can
  improve or even cure various inflammatory diseases: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4284325 http://www.voanews.com/content/inflammatory-bowel-disease-cured-with-fecal-transplant/2609711.html http://genomemag.com/change-your-microbiome-change-yourself/#.VzH6YaMrLeR The problem is that FMT is currently only available privately, at the
  Taymount Clinic which is the other side of the country to me. I
  am therefore seeking £10,000 funding to cover the cost of the two-week
  initial treatment, travel expenses, accommodation/food, and follow up
  home treatments (these are recommended for up to two years and are
  £240 each) http://taymount.com/faq The human microbiome is a ""hot topic"" in medical
  research right now, and I have no doubt will one day be a standard
  treatment, however I do not have time to wait. Despite my best efforts, the gut problems are worsening, and
  earlier this year following an infection which required antibiotics,
  my blood counts dropped to the point I needed transfusions again. Unfortunately I have now developed autoimmune antibodies to most
  donated blood. This means my immune system destroys the donor blood
  cells: a potentially fatal complication. It is very rare for someone
  who has had so few transfusions, and may be another factor in the
  underlying condition. I am what is referred to here as a hyper-responder and it
  limits conventional treatment options somewhat. It feels like I am in a race against time to find a solution to this
  horrible disease. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ If I can get funding for this treatment, I will document the process
  and outcome in detail. I would not be doing this if I didn't think
  there was a good chance of success, but whatever the outcome, we will
  be helping others who might be considering the treatment, make a more
  informed decision. If it is successful, I will be campaigning to get
  this recognized and available on the NHS...which would make a world of
  difference to those of us who cannot afford private treatment. Thank you for reading, and for any donations, however small. Your
  generosity is really appreciated. To pre-empt some questions! * Aren't you just clutching at straws? This is a matter of perception. Some may call it clutching at straws
  - I call it leaving no stone unturned. I do not believe that serious
  illness ""just happens"", and idiopathic merely means that the
  cause has not yet been found. I will never stop looking! * But there is no evidence! Absence of evidence means merely that. As far as I know, no MDS
  patient has ever tried FMT, so until someone does, there will never be
  any evidence one way or another. If this works it will prove a clear link between the microbiome and
  bone marrow function, and hopefully encourage further research,
  potentially saving many lives. How exciting would that be! * So you think you have found a magic cure? Nothing that simplistic. I have just made what I see as a logical
  association between two issues I have, found scientific research that
  backs up the link, and evidence that this procedure might help one of them. There are many subtypes of MDS with different causes and patterns of
  symptoms, and my case may be very different to others. And of course I
  may be completely wrong about the cause of my illness and/or the
  efficacy of FMT for Bile Acid Malabsorption - I am not a doctor and
  this is an experimental treatment! * But it sounds like quackery! Far from it. FMT is undergoing clinical trials in Universities all
  over the world, and the microbiome is one of the fastest growing areas
  of medical research. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fecal+transplant+evidence * What about conventional treatment? Isn't there a cure? If there was a drug to cure MDS I would take it! Unfortunately all
  current treatments have their downsides. To quote one friend, MDS is a
  ""damned if you do, damned if you don't disease"". For
  instance the lifesaving blood transfusions that many of us rely on
  result in a build-up of iron in the body, which can cause heart
  attacks and liver failure. Drugs can reduce the iron, but can damage
  the kidneys and cause deafness. A bone marrow transplant using cells
  from an unrelated donor is the only potentially curative option,
  however this is a hugely risky procedure with a high rate of relapse.
  It is not a decision to be taken lightly, and risks currently outweigh
  the benefits. I am not anti conventional treatment, and FMT can be
  done alongside, so it is not an either/or situation. * What if it doesn't work? Obviously I will be very disappointed, but at least I will be able to
  move on and better assess my next options. And any data is useful for
  researchers. Many people with other chronic conditons have reported
  good outcomes, so even if it does not improve my blood counts, I am
  cautiously optimistic it could help my gut. There is even evidence
  that improving the diversity of microbiota may reduce GVHD, one of the
  most dangerous side effects of a bone marrow transplant, should I ever
  need to go down that route. http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/145859 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133489 Please note: if you are considering trying any
      alternative treatments it is essential to discuss this with your
      doctor first, as some supplements may worsen your condition or
      react with your medication. And if you have any new or undiagnosed
      gut symptoms, you need to get them checked out immediately - do
      not self-diagnose! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ http://mdsguthealth.blogspot.co.uk","7,577",of £10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/mdsguthealth,Please help fund my fight against MDS,30,,Pound Sterling
"Hello everyone. Most of you know me pretty well. But you might not
  know Janet, my ex-wife. Even though we are not together anymore, we
  are still good friends. What you might not know about Janet is what a
  wonderful, giving person she is. I can tell you that our breakup six
  years ago was nothing to do with anything Janet did wrong. She is a
  wonderful person. She was a wonderful wife to me and a great mum to
  our two children Daniel and Gemma, and she cared for her father in our
  home for thirty years, until his recent death at 94 years of age.
  Another thing you might not know, is that Janet has been battling
  breast cancer for more than 13 years! The cancer was so aggressive
  initially that, within three months of her detecting it, her breast
  grew to twice its normal size. Because of the speed of growth it was
  impossible to remove safely so the doctors gave her chemo to shrink
  the tumour, which worked successfully. Her breast was then removed,
  along with several affected lymph nodes. She was then put through
  painful and debilitating radiation in an attempt to kill any surviving
  cells. The long battle has been hard, but Janet is a battler with a
  fierce will to live. However, the battle is now getting more difficult
  for her. During the last 13 years the tumour has returned several
  times resulting in several rounds of chemo. After each round the
  tumour has shrunk .... but not disappeared. The surviving cells become
  immune to each drug, which means that the oncologists have to
  introduce a new drug each round. They are running out of options, and
  the tumours have recently come back with a vengeance and are showing
  right across her chest. I am constant researching alternative
  treatments. There are several that look promising, but the problem is
  that they are all quite expensive. Janet needs your help. Let's get
  her well again.",520,of $5k goal,https://www.realp2p.com/319xLb,Help Janet fight this awful disease.,14,,New Zealand Dollar

  he spent four weeks in ICU fighting for his life. Robyn, a devoted

  Children's hospital in Cape Town where he has been diagnosed with
  cancer. Doctors have been unable to diagnose the exact type that he
  has but we are told he has eight cancerous tumours throughout his
  body. He now needs to have six months of intensive chemo to try and
  give him a chance to survive. Robyn has had to abandon her PhD studies and relocate to Cape Town to
  be with her boy during his gruelling treatment. She can't work and has
  very little money at her disposal. Bengui has now been in hospital for
  five weeks. Any donated money will be given directly to Robyn to help her pay her

  it is going to become harder and harder to keep from having to switch

"Life has a way of presenting the most challenging moments to tackle.
  Our nanny Miriam is currently dealing with one of those moments.
  Miriam was diagnosed with Leukemia January, 2016. She is currently
  undergoing aggressive chemotherapy at the Princess Margaret Cancer
  Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Her illness is of a very serious
  nature and potentially life threatening and we are dedicating
  ourselves to support Miriam in this fight to survive cancer. Miriam moved to Canada in 2007. She came from the Philippines without
  her immediate family in order to work and provide financial support to
  her family back in the Philippines. She is married and has two sons.
  Her dream has always been to bring her family to Canada so that they
  could all have the same opportunities we as Canadians are so fortunate
  to have. Her husband is a farmer and her two sons have spent the last few
  years getting an education to better themselves and have an
  opportunity to come to Canada. Their dream is to be reunited with
  Miriam. She sacrificed spending her life without her family in order
  to work and provide for her family financially. We have been blessed
  to have her in our lives. During the past 5 years, Miriam has been an
  integral part of our family working for our family and also assisting
  us as a nanny taking care of our son Laurence since he was born. It is
  now our time to give back and to help Miriam through this challenging
  time to fight against Leukemia. She faces emotional and financial
  challenges ahead without her immediate family by her side. Her focus
  is to battle this disease. Our focus is to support her in any way we can. Prior to being diagnosed with Leukemia, Miriam become a Permanent
  Resident of Canada and therefore, eligible for OHIP. The problem is
  that she does not have any medical coverage and cannot afford to pay
  for drug treatment. Financial support should not be a burden to anyone
  who is severely ill. She desperately needs financial support to assist
  her with her medication and other financial burdens. We have had
  confirmation that Miriam requires a bone marrow.  Her siblings back in
  the Philippines are currently being tested to determine whether they
  are a match. If one of her siblings is a match, Miriam will have the
  expense of bringing her sibling to Canada to undergo procedures to
  help save her life. There are so many unpredictable factors on this journey and we want
  Miriam to be able to focus on her health and not the exterior burdens
  that she is faced with. She doesn’t have to fight this battle alone.
  My family and I are here to support her but there is no doubt she
  requires financial assistance in order to deal with the foreseeable
  financial commitments. We ask that family and friends help support
  Miriam by giving. We have named this fundraiser ""Everyone’s Life Matters… Life Matters to
  Everyone"" because we truly believe everyone has the
  right to live! Please support this cause by passing on this
  information to those who may be able to assist and by donating to this

  dégénérative héréditaire. Au fur et à mesure que l’enfant atteint
  grandit, ses muscles s’affaiblissent. Cela est dû au fait que son
  organisme n’est pas capable de produire la protéine musculaire appelée
  dystrophine. Lorsqu’elles manquent de cette protéine, les cellules
  musculaires s’affaiblissent et dégénèrent progressivement. La DMD est
  une maladie qui affecte généralement les garçons (elle est très rare
  chez les filles). Les signes de faiblesse commencent à apparaître entre trois et cinq
  ans (quelquefois plus tôt). Au début, les symptômes se manifestent
  surtout au niveau des jambes et des hanches. Voici quelques-uns des
  symptômes que l’enfant peut présenter : chutes fréquentes; difficultés à courir aussi rapidement que ses amis; difficultés à grimper les escaliers; difficultés à se relever d’une chaise; gonflement progressif des mollets; tendance à marcher souvent sur ses orteils et à se pencher en
    arrière pour maintenir son équilibre; Progressivement, cette faiblesse entraînera des difficultés à marcher
  et la personne atteinte aura besoin d’un fauteuil roulant.
  Graduellement, tous les muscles deviendront extrêmement affaiblis y
  compris le muscle cardiaque et les muscles de la respiration. Devenu adulte, François n’a aucune force musculaire
  afin de se servir de tous ses membres. Se déplaçant en fauteuil
  roulant, il éprouve aussi une incapacité à se nourrir, boire, se
  gratter et bien d’autres activités de la vie quotidienne. Dans son

"Connected Through Sport Society ® is a
        non-profit entity designed to provide a safe and healthy

        of the main goals of Connected Through Sport
        Society ® (CTS) allows those people in recovery
        to participate anonymously in community sports, offering them a
        healthy alternative lifestyle from addictions, such as: Alcohol,
        Opioids, Amphetamines, Cocaine, Cannabis, etc. Serving residents
        of the East Kootenay region in British Columbia, CTS aims to
        reduce the stigma so often associated with mental health. The
        non-profit society provides community integration, teamwork,
        motivation, inspiration, health and connection. Membership is free and available to all persons 18 years of
        age or older. All those, regardless of length of time in

"Mindy Mallett is most generous and giving woman I know. She's given
  her life and money to animal rescue and rehabilitatation. A lot of
  people know her through Sunrise Sanctuary, but most don’t know that
  the mortgage, taxes, property and help for any bills the donation
  don't cover along with the utilities have been paid by Mindy for over
  17 years. She has always worked full time on top of volunteering her
  time at the sanctuary because even with donations there’s never enough. Mindy’s older now and having some health issues that come along
    with age and is struggling to cover the high out of pocket cost of
    her self paid minimum coverage insurance for some injuries at the
    sanctuary and other health issues. Mindy's main need besides
    covering the other medical bills is foot surgery on both feet, which
    will have her down for up to four months. The surgery will cost her
    over $6000 out of pocket because of the insurance she has. She has
    always been too proud to ask for help, so I asked her if she cared
    if I did and she reluctantly said yes. Here's two pictures of her feet so you can see for yourself how
    bad they've gotten. They have become deformed and she's on her feet
    at least 11 hours a day to do everything she needs to do in a day.
    Many days at the end of the day she can't even walk anymore. Please
    consider helping her get the help she needs. Anything Mindy raises above her needs she'll donate back to the
    sanctuary. She’s put off her surgery for years now to the point
    she’s having a lot of trouble walking and even getting her feet into
    a pair of shoes. But she refuses to have the much needed surgery
    until she’s sure everything is covered including the other medical
    bills she's been paying on. Please help Mindy through this time so
    she can get back on her feet (literally.)",190,of $10.5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/fortheloveofanimals,Mindy's Given It All To Animals and Now Needs Help,4,,U.S. Dollar
"Since 2013, two PhD students at the University of Bergen, Norway
  started a fundraiser for women's cancer here in Bergen called Frock it Bergen . This initiative was
    inspi red by Frocktober , which is an annual
    charity event run by the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation in
    Australia. The idea is to wear a different dress, every day in
    October, to raise money and awareness for gynaecological cancers
    such as endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer etc.
    Many women's cancers are hard to detect, while others need routine
    checks that many of us women don't know about. This year, we have
    chosen to give our full support to Gynkreftforeningen , for their meaningful work in
    spreading awareness and supporting patients with gynaecological
    cancers and their loved ones. We encourage everyone to form their
    own teams and join us to complete this challenge, and we hope that
    you will follow our activities this October as we frock to defrock
    women's cancer! Follow us: www.instagram.com/frockitbergen www.frockitbergen.tumblr.com www.facebook.com/frockitbergen I 2013 startet to doktorgradsstudenter ved
  Universitetet i Bergen en kampanje med navn Frock it
  Bergen . Målet med kampanjen er å sette fokus på kvinnekreft
  og samle inn penger til dette formålet. Initiativet ble inspirert av Frocktober , som er et årlig
  veldedighetsarrangement i regi av Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation i
  Australia. Tanken er å ha på forskjellige kjoler hver dag i oktober,
  for å skape oppmerksomhet rundt gynekologiske kreftformer som
  livmorkreft, eggstokkreft, livmorhalskreft etc. Mange former for
  kvinnekreft er vanskelig å oppdage på grunn av vage symptomer. Noen av
  kreftformene krever rutinekontroller som mange av oss kvinner ikke vet
  om. I år har vi valgt å gi pengene som samles inn til Gynkreftforeningen , for deres meningsfylte arbeid
  med bevisstgjøring samt støtte til pasienter med gynekologisk kreft og
  deres kjære. Vi oppfordrer alle til å danne sine egne lag og ta
  utfordringen sammen med oss. Vi håper at du vil følge våre aktiviteter
  i oktober mens vi ""frock to defrock"" kvinnekreft! Følg oss: www.instagram.com/frockitbergen www.frockitbergen.tumblr.com www.facebook.com/frockitbergen","22,700",of kr50k goal,https://fundrazr.com/frockitbergen2016,Frock it Bergen 2016 - defrocking women's cancer!,85,,Norwegian Krone

"My 13 year old, Ronin was born with male genitals, but as the years
  have past, and she has her own ideas about who she is, and how she
  views the world around her, she is 150% positive that she is actually
  a female.  As her mother, I am positive as well.  She has been living
  as a girl for the past 9 months or so, but as puberty seems to be
  really starting, we are both very worried about the affects
  testosterone will have on her body and emotions.  We have been mad
  aware of ""puberty blockers"" but, as insurance won't cover
  this, and my funds are limited, we are looking for help to get us
  through this phase of Ronin's transition. Just FYI: Most insurance plans will not pay for puberty inhibitors
  and they can be cost prohibitive.  The implant is effective for
  approximately one year; however, may last months longer and
  effectiveness can be checked by blood test. The cost varies from
  $4,500-$15,000 and must be inserted by a surgeon.  Monthly injections
  are approximately $1,200 per month.  This will not include the cost of
  other necessary treatment, such as: blood work, x-rays, office visits
  with the physician, etc. Ronin is a very talented singer, and the oncome of male puberty is a
  threat to her beautiful voice, which she plans on showing off more
  publicly this summer at open mic events around our town. Any little bit of help is appreciated, even if it's $5 or maybe a

"Hey. My name is Simon (some of you may know me as SWEGTA on various social media platforms and websites). I have a little
  something called Vitreous Detachment , which has left my
  vision filled with bothersome and distracting flashes and floaters . This all began at age 12, which I dealth with in an alright manner. However, recently it has gotten way worse. I've looked into treatment in Sweden, but it's very limited and
  rarely offered (especially due to my age). But there is an alternative solution. It's called Vitreolysis and is done via laser. Getting
  this treatment would potentially clear my vision and restore it back
  to the way it was 10 years ago. I would give anything for that to
  happen, but due to my limited finances I am unable to pay for this
  procedure myself. I've started a small saving which I aim to fill on a monthly basis
  until the year 2017. By the end of this year, I'll pick a location,
  travel there and hopefully get my treatment. Any donation (no matter at what number) is greatly appreciated
    and something that will help me get closer to my goal. Getting this treatment would mean the world to me and improve my
  perspective (both mentally and visually) on this world. Thank you for taking your time to read this. // Simon (aka SWEGTA) Update: 11/01 - 2016 I have booked an appointment with a specialist in Stockholm who can help me with this problem. This lowers my goal from 1,300 USD to 1,000. It also eliminates any traveling expenses I would've otherwise had to deal with.

"Our 4 1/2 year old Maltese has been suffering ever since she got a
  rabies vaccine a couple months ago.  It started gradually with some
  tremors in her right hind leg but has progressed to seizures and some
  parallysis and instabitlity in all four limbs.  Our vet could not
  figure out what was wrong with her and finally after giving her
  antiinflamatories with no effect referred her for a neuro consult
  about a week ago.  At that poiint she had deteriorated to where she
  was falling on her face every third step, could not stand to urinate
  or move her bowels etc.  The trauma Dr. and Neuro Specialist have been
  running diagnostic tests that have already costs over $3500 on top of
  the Vet bills prior of about $750.  Monday they want to do an MRI,  a
  Spinal Tap, a liver biopsy, and an angiogram which could be another
  $5000 + all still trying to diagnose what is truely wrong.  They
  suspect it is Granulomatous meningoencephalitis and/or microvascular
  dysplasia. If it is microvascular dysplasia it will require surgery. For a bit more information on GME check out this link  http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/archive/2014/08/03/granulomatous-meningoencephalitis.aspx We love our little girl and want to do everything to help her.

  just very scary seeing all these expenses add up when you only bring
  home a couple thousand a month and you are seeing about 6 months of
  your take home pay already spent just trying to diaganose what is
  ailing this beautiful loving sweet helpless gift.   I don't like
  asking for help, but this is starting to get quite overwhelming. I am
  lucky to have a great boss who has let me take the time to get her to
  the appointments she has needed and spend the time with her to keep
  her safe.  One of the  types of seizures she has causes her to scratch
  her head with her hind leg without the ability to stop herself and she
  starts to cry until someone helps her stop. I would hate to think the
  pain she would be in if I wasn't there to help calm her.  It is so
  heart breaking hearing her yelps and see look in her eyes as she does
  not understand what is going on. If you have the ability to help at all, FiFi is so worth it. She is
  the sweetest most loving precious little girl you could ever meet.
   When we take her to the park she has to run up to everyone sitting on
  the lawn to say  hi and try to give them a kiss.  She loves people so
  much and brings smiles to peoples faces when they see her.  Our UPS
  and FEDEX drivers stop by just to see her to perk up thier days. Right
  now she can hardly stand on her own, she stumbles after just a few
  steps, falls over when she tries to turn . . . it is so sad not so see

"Well where to begin...this started almost 7 yrs ago..I was out
  playing basketball with my daughter as we often did and the next
  morning I couldn't get up...out of bed at all. I felt like I had been
  hit by a truck. At first we thought it was a bad flu...but as time
  went on I got sicker with more and more complications. My job went
  from full time to part tI me to minimal to nothing...and I just kept
  getting sicker. First I had flu like symptoms a super stiff
  neck..chronic fatigue  and severe shoulder blade pain and weakness. I
  couldn't turn my neck I could hardly walk low energy felt I was going
  to faint and had heavy heart palpitations. Then it moved to my
  reproductive system and much pain and many cysts appeared. .and they
  found an adnexal cyst which the doc thought could be cancerous so I
  had it removed and it wasn't thank god.we thought. Then my blood was
  affected low iron needing iron iv for 2 yrs at the RGH. Then all the
  seizures started all the neuro Lyme problems....blurred vision,loss of
  hearing, throat closing, Ms symptoms,  loss of balance, dropping
  things, impaired speech. I developed soft tissue rheumatism and beg.
  of ms. Asthma, allergies, low immunity many infections crept in. Got
  chronic fatigue syndrome , epilepsy, old granulomatous disease on my
  right lung, Raynauds,  spondylosis of the spine and much more. LYME
  DISEASE causes all of this and it circulates around your
  body..imitating many illnesses. I have over 100 symptoms and I keep
  getting diagnosed with more. We were told I had cancer, lupus, Ms and

  siblings. He is a son . Over two months ago, Erik was getting treated for what was originally
  thought to be an infection in the intestines . His condition
  started to drastically dropped. He was then admitted into hospital,
  all while still being treated for what was thought to be an infection.
  The hospital was making plans to give him blood transfusions and the
  likes, just to cure this infection. Then Erik slipped into a coma and our worst nightmares began. What we
  thought had been an infection, was cancer this entire time. It wasn't
  an intestinal infection, it was intestinal cancer . Over the last month has been pretty rough. For the length of just
  under a week, Erik would spend nights where he would stop breathing 3 up to 5 times . After that week, we
  got some news that his heartbeat and breathing is starting to
  stabilize. We started to breathe easy. Until they told us that he
  started having violent spasms accompanied by fever . When Erik's younger brother, my best friend, told me about the
  situation, things started to really kick into gear for me. We had to
  find a way to make it work. I started working two jobs, asking for
  small donations from family and friends. What we raised was barely enough to keep up with the extremely steep
  medical bills. We made a great effort and managed to cover a quarter
  of said bills. However, this is our last dash attempt. The hospital told us that we
  had until the 10th of November to earn $1,200 to cover the previous amount that we still
  owed. We are trying our best to talk it through and negotiate more
  time with the hospital. This is why I have come on here. I am looking for ways that I could
  possibly raise money in that limited amount of time to pay for the
  medical fees. I know this is an incredible feat. I am nobody to ask
  this from any single person. I just really do need help. I refuse to
  stop fighting for Erik on this side, considering Erik won't stop
  fighting in there. He is 39 years old, he has so much more of life yet to live. He

"My Mom is Michelle McClurg & I'm her 16yr Old Son Travis McClurg
  Trying To Do A Fundraiser For My Mom. She has now had 11 surgeries
  since March 2014. My mom has had Cervical Cancer, Breast Cancer, Lumps
  in her knee that had to be removed & a Lump in her Stomach which
  has caused many other health issues. She still has lumps in her jaw,
  cheek, left side behind her ribs, one in her left nostril, she has
  lumps going all down her esophagus, throat, tonsils, back of her
  tongue & on each side. ( they believe that's why she has a new
  large mass in her stomach now) My mother now has Gastroparesis which
  is very rare & very painful there is not a lot of information
  about it & there is no cure! My Mom had to have a special test
  where they had her eat One microwaved scrambled egg with radiation on
  it then they put her in a radiation machine that followed the dye
  that's on the scrambled egg. She was in there for six hours then they
  gave her a two hour break then they put her back in the machine for
  another two hours. The results were that after eight hours of being in
  the machine & a two hour break only 8% of that ONE scrambled egg
  digested which means my mom's GI Track is paralyzed /shut down from
  her esophagus to her anus. She lost 60lbs in one month & they told
  her that there was nothing more that they were able to do for her.
  That wasn't good enough for my mom so she called every doctor she ever
  met, saw or talked too & even other doctors that knew other
  doctors tried to come with ideas to help my mom due to how severe she
  is, there were little to no options left for her. They came up with a
  G & J Tube that the hoses comes out of her left side of her
  stomach it's NOT a Feeding Tube. The J Tube is located on the left
  side of her near her Pancreas going into the intestine that puts the
  nutrients in & flushes with water every two hours. It gets clogged
  a lot & we have had many problems with both hoses that are
  available the two company's should get together & take the good
  parts from the one & the good parts from the other due to neither
  of them work that great. The G tube hose is connected to her esophagus
  with a ""tree connector"" that's what connects the J Tube
  & cavity that's connected to a bag where all the bio, skin, blood,
  any clear liquid she drinks to wet her mouth to keep it moist &
  any ice cream she may sneak in once at night cause it can go down the
  hose but even that has made her throw up & that's not something
  you see everyday due to anything she throws up is what is in the waste
  bag cause she doesn't eat or drink. She started getting sick again
  here & there almost a month ago but we've learned how to quickly
  get the nausea taken care of at times it works & sometimes it
  don't. They only give you one waste bag once a month so I have to
  clean it & trust me, who ever came up with that rule at the
  insurance company if they came here & emptied the waste bag ONCE
  they would give you a lot more. We have had bags break, get leaks in
  the weirdest places, my mom passes out a lot & there are times she
  has almost pulled the hose right out of her stomach. Her memory has
  gotten really bad to the point she doesn't remember watching a movie,
  talking in a conversation or even sometimes she has even forgotten the
  whole day. She has had lumps appear on her her head but hasn't fallen
  & has done nothing to cause the lumps. She gets migraines almost
  everyday now along with bloody noises, sensitivity to the light or
  sound. Put it this way she is not the Michelle we all love & know.
  I do all her IV bage which are just nutrients to give her what she
  needs & keep her alive along with water. The IV gets changed
  everyday plus her commode has to be emptied two to three times a day
  cause she has lost almost all her muscle & has very little energy
  to be able to get to the bathroom by herself safely. She has a
  wheelchair for when we need to go to the hospital but if we are not
  going to a doctor or hospital my mom has to stay home in bed 24/7.
  She's to weak to do things & time to time she gets a little rush
  then over does it then pays for it. Now with me being back to school
  they allow me to drive & have my phone with me during school but I
  worry about her all day cause I make sure she has her meds close by
  plus other things to help her through the day but we don't have any
  family close by that can help & we have a few friends that do
  stuff here & there but they have their own lives, get busy, &
  just run out of time. We are not eligible for any government programs
  due to my mom worked hard, ( she feels like she's being punished by
  the government for paying taxes, having a good job, college &
  staying off of welfare) made sure she had long term disability but
  what they didn't tell her it wouldn't be enough & just enough to
  be NOT eligible for Medicad & other programs that could help us
  now cause you can't make over $800 a month. We have cut back on
  everything obviously the first thing is food, then cable, electric,
  gas things we need but then go with out & it's still not helping.
  The bills are getting more & more piled up? The medical bills have
  to sit in a pile behind the Must Pay Bills! My mom taught me how to do
  the bills cause she has gotten so sick now that just getting up to pay
  a bill is a lot for her. I try to do physical therapy everyday but
  lately it just doesn't seem like there is not enough time in the day
  to do everything, there are times we don't get done until 1a. On a
  school night. My mom has other health problems from being so sick
  & the result of getting Cancer. She has Sjögren's Syndrome which
  is a Auto immune deficiency that effects her eyes by giving her dry
  eyes then gets horrible nerve pain in her Jaw, chin & teeth. She
  told me it feels like her jaw is broke & someone is ripping her
  teeth out with pliers! It took two weeks for the medication to kick in
  plus it costs $189 a month & they explained to my mom after she
  told them it was to expensive for her to pay that's the best one for
  her to be one due to how severe it is. The prescriptions each month
  are outrageous & there have been times lately that my mom hasn't
  been able to get some of her MEDS due to we don't have the money for
  it. She also has severe fibromyalgia that is constinatly flared up due
  to her body not being able to rest, heal or not be so stressed out
  worrying about everything. We had a nursing staff but it's no longer
  available due to our health care policy & they told her she would
  have to pay independently. She had nurses aids that would help her get
  dressed, take a shower, brush her teeth or just anything else she
  needed done for her or the house now we don't have that so its created
  more stress on the both of us.  I have watched my mom over the years
  help so many people, do things that people don't even know about &
  she would always tell me that if you brag it wasn't done with good
  intensions, you did it cause you felt inside that you needed to help
  this person or thing. Well that's what we are asking for Not Charity

  continued to swell and experience the effects of anemia. On April 8, 2016, Hannah finally got some answers. She was diagnosed
  with aggressive Lupus, and began a treatment that included Cellcept.
  She was referred to a nephrologist as her kidneys were now being
  attacked by the Lupus. On April 27th she underwent a kidney biopsy.
  This biopsy reveled that she had Stage 4 and Stage 5 Lupus. She was hospitalized and immediately began dialysis. On April 30th
  she started Chemo to attack the Lupus. She was hospitalized for nine
  days to treat the kidney Lupus. She was very excited to be released
  from the hospital on May 5th. She went home determined to beat the
  Lupus. She started her outpatient dialysis treatment the following
  Saturday, May 7th. Her next scheduled dialysis treatment was May 10. Unfortunately for Hannah, three days was too long to go between
  dialysis treatments. On May 9th she was taken to ER and admitted into
  the hospital with respiratory distress and congestive heart failure.
  The doctors continue to work to release the pressure around her heart
  and lungs by draining the fluid that surrounds her lungs. They are
  also ordering daily dialysis in hope to be able to pull the fluid away
  from her heart. Unfortunately, Hannah’s aggressive Lupus has affected her heart and
  kidneys. The Doctor’s remain hopeful that with the Chemo they can stop
  the Lupus from attacking her kidneys, which will help to put her Lupus
  in remission. As of right now, Hannah is still being monitored in the
  hospital to determine if daily dialysis is needed. Her team of
  ‘ologists (nephrologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, rheumatologist,
  hematologist, oncologist) are treating the effects of the kidney Lupus
  and keeping a close eye on her to determine if the Lupus is attacking
  any new organs. The current plan, once she leaves the hospital, is to
  continue with Chemo treatments every two weeks for three months as
  well as dialysis three times a week. Please pray for her as she continues on this journey.","5,225",of $14k goal,https://fundrazr.com/618Cq7,Help Hannah Blue Fight Lupus,52,,U.S. Dollar

"Hi I'm Jayne I'm a 48 year old mum of three. Around eight years ago I
  was struct down by the incurable illness that is multiple sclerosis
  also known as MS and since then it has changed my families life
  dramatically. Going from a full time personal trainer to being unable
  to walk to the shops and spending most my days housebound. The illness I have will get progressively worse over time and I can't
  simply live with this for much longer. The money that I am trying to
  raise is for stem cell treatment called HSCT which is not available on
  the NHS. The illness has had massive financial implications with my
  husband being the main source of income for my family so I cannot
  afford the cost of the treatment. The treatment involves taking my stem cells, freezing them then going
  through four days of chemo, then the doctors will re-inject the stem
  cells and my body would be in simple terms, rebooted and MS free. With
  91% success rate I am very eager to go ahead with this although it is
  very harsh and expensive treatment. This is where I need your help!
  Simply give anything you can to help me make this happen. It is a very
  harsh and expensive treatment but I am willing to go through with it
  so I can get my life back on track! Thank you xxx Reported in The Daily Mail, Telegraph and on GMTV 3/3/15!!!! BBC Panorama 18/1/16 !!!!!","24,804",of £34k goal,https://fundrazr.com/4w1Wa,Please help JAYNE have STEMCELLS  2 STOP HER MS,388,,Pound Sterling

  round of radiation and chemo, they found no cancer cells. However, he
  still has a long and expensive road ahead. He has 6 months of intense
  chemo, along with many holistic treatments to help his body recover,
  much of which is not covered by insurance. He will also be out of work
  for some of this time. So here is WHERE WE COME IN!!!! Patrick is one of the most remarkable people you could ever meet. He
  truly is the poppa bear to a large group of friends and his wife and
  daughter. He consistently goes out of his way to organize events and
  trips to keep a number of strong friendships alive! He is the most
  committed, supportive husband and one of the most dedicated fathers so
  many dream to have! He is sincerely one of a kind. They don't make
  many like him. He is always thinking of others and lending a helping hand. Now it's our turn to lend Patrick a helping hand! There is a very
  solid chance he can keep the cancer out but it will be a long journey.
  Please open your hearts and donate whatever you can to help Patrick
  and his family through this difficult time. We are trying to make sure

"Unseen illness isn't always easy to diagnose and I haven't had a lot
  of luck with traditonal western medicine though in the spring of 2015
  I felt like I got another chance at life when I did get help from a
  doctor. The doctor wasn't able to diagnose me specifically unless I
  wanted a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia because my numbers to confirm a
  more serious illness, Lupus, was off by three points of a diagnosis.
  He did confirm I have Arthritis and an auto-immune disorder which
  flares up and down so some days are good and some days are not. I was
  in severe nerve pain off and on for two years prior and spent many
  days in bed. The pain travels wherever and whenever it wants and
  stress makes it worse. I was given a choice to try some medication that might take the
  nerve pain away and I did and thankfully it worked. When I was able to
  move around again I didn't want to waste time on any more days in bed
  so I got my backpack and tent and headed for the West Coast where I
  lived before for 15 years. The fresh ocean air and the extra oxygen in the forest and
  friends always lift my spirits. After a couple of months I had to return home to Alberta but I
  was thankful for the time I had there and worked part time. It felt
  really good to not be stuck inside in bed in silence with only a few
  freinds and family knowing what I was going through. This past spring in 2016 I had another opportunity to return to
  the West Coast and I stayed with friends up and down the island. I
  worked a litte part time to earn enough money to eat and get from A to
  B and somehow I kept going until I had to come back to Alberta to help
  my mother. I sold and gave away most of my belongings because I needed
  money to live and I clearly need to travel light, some days I am not
  as strong as others. The thing is I used up most of the money just living day to day
  for the past eight weeks and need some help now to get back to my
  family and friends on the West Coast and to the forests and the ocean where I find it easiest to
  breathe and where my health seems to be much better and I have more
  access to alternative healers and medicines and things that uplift my spirit. Every litle bit helps and if you can chip in anything it will be
  greatly appreciated. I am thankful for this journey . Deanna","1,320",of $2.5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/71AZSc,I Am Healthiest Breathing The Forest And Ocean Air,23,,Canadian Dollar

"For English scroll down please. An
        update to Armenuhi's condition and new surgery dates. There has been an unexpected
    tooth inflammation & sinusitis that postponed the initially
    planned surgeries of Armenuhi (for 22th & 28th of
    November 2016). Armenuhi had a successful tooth surgery
      at Oral & Maxillofacial clinic at
    ""Alexandrovska"" Hospital Sofia. To continue with
    the epilepsy treatment the sinutitis inflammation needs to be
    cleared. Doctors hope with intense treatment it will be managed
    within a month and Armenuhi will be stable enough for the initially
    planned surgeries. Therefore the admission and first operation of
    Armenuhi are postponed for 9th of January 2017. At 9.12.2016 we got
    approval from Bulgarian authorities for Armenuhi and her mother to
    prolong their stay in the country. Around 20th of December we will
    know if inflamation treatment is going well after the scheduled tests. Our fundrising campaign will
      continue as the initially planned epilepsy treatment is not
      canceled but postponed. Our help to Armenuhi is still relevant and
      even more needed given the circumstances. You can follow up every
      update on this page. Новини
        за състоянието на Арменухи и нови дати за операции. След пристигането на Арменухи в
    България, лекарите откриват неочаквано възпаление на зъб и синузит,
    които отлагат на плануваните операции (на 22.11 и 28.11.2016г).
    Арменухи е оперирана от възпаления зъб в Лицево-челюстна хирургия
    към Александровска болница София. За да премине към лечение на
    епилепсията, синузитът трябва да бъде излекуван. Лекарите се
    надяват, че чрез интензивно лечение след месец състоянието на
    Арменухи ще позволи операция за лекуване на епилепсията. Затова
    първата операция и приемането й в боницата ""Св. Иван
    Рилкси"" София се отлага за 9 януари 2017. Българските власти
    удължиха претоя на Арменухи и майка й в страната. Около 20 декември
    са предвидени тестове, за да се разбере, дали лечението на
    инфекцията върви по план. Нашата кампания за набиране на
      средства продължава, тъй като втората операция, необходима за
      лечението на епилепсията на Арменухи не отпада, а се отлага.
      Всъщност нашата помощ сега е още по-необходима. Ще ви държим в
      течение на тази страница. За Арменухи и нейното състояние. Арменухи Епископосян e на 23г. от Ереван. Тя страда от тежка
  симптоматична фокална (десностранна фронтална) епилепсия, при неясна
  съдова малформация и вероятна фокална кортикална дисплазия. Има
  ежедневни, тежки припадъци. За жалост необходимото изследване и операция, за пълното оздравяване
  на Арменухи не могат да бъдат проведени в Армения. Затова с помощта на нейният лекар в Ереван, д-р. Биайна Сухудян,
  началник отделение ""Неврология"" към медицински институт
  ""Арабкир"", и доц. д-р. Петя Димова, невролог към МБАЛ

  ""Св. Иван Рилски"" на 21.11.2016г. където може да получи
  адекватното лечение. Ще я придружава нейната майка, Светлана Багхян. About Armenuhi and her condition. Armenuhi Yepiskoposyan is a 23

    излекувана след планираните операции и ще заживее нормален живот,
    без ежедневни припадъци. What treatment does Armenuhi
      need to get better? Armenuhi is going to be admitted
    at “St Ivan Rilski” University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria at 21st
    of Nov 2016. She is scheduled for diagnostic tests and surgery at
    hospital’s Epilepsy Surgery Center. The treatment plan includes a
    Stereo-EEG (as a first step) and tailored epilepsy surgery (with
    neuronavigation and neuromonitoring) in order to delineate the
    seizure onset zone in the right frontal lobe and to preserve the
    motor eloquent areas. The total hospital stay is planned to be circa
    3-4 weeks. Armenuhi’s doctors expect she will be completely cured
    after the planned treatment. Как мога да помогна? По време на престоя в клиниката ще бъдат проведени следните дейности,

  They were all born premature, the earliest at 25 weeks weighing
  1lb13oz. Despite their early appearances, none had health issues due
  to prematurity, a miracle in itself. We are facing many other health
  issues though. Our 8th miracle was diagnosed with many birth defects before birth.
  We were told it would be a miracle if she survived until birth, but
  she did. She was diagnosed with a condition called OEIS complex and
  has already undergone over 20 surgeries with more to come. We have to
  travel out of state for her care. Our 5th miracle was diagnosed with cancer in her foot in 2015. She
  underwent 7 rounds of chemotherapy before loosing her leg. She is
  doing great with a prosthetic but because she is still growing, she
  needs new ones every 6 months. We also have our first miracle who has had type 1 diabetes for 10
  years and our 2nd and 7th Miracles joined that club in 2015 as well. We need to come up with funds to pay for our out of state travels, a
  new prosthetic, 4 insulin pumps (I have t1 diabetes too) as well as a

"The purpose of this is to assist with expenses connected to our sweet, strong Lilly's medical expenses along with our expenses as we begin a long journey to get her completely healthy.  Jamie and I found out at 28 weeks that our dear Lilly had contracted what is called Autosomal Recessive (or Infantile) Polycystic Kidney Disease, aka ARPKD.  Little is known about this disease because it is 1. very rare ( 1:40,000), 2. often undetected because it doesn't show up until late in pregnancy, and 3. those few babies with the disease often do not make it past their 1st month of life. Since Lilly's birth on 1/15/2013, she has yet to come home and has been in the Neonatal ICU ever since; going on 6 weeks now.  From the day we were lucky enough to welcome her, Lilly had already beaten so many odds and has had a game plan all her own.  Our journey has also contributed to an insane emotional roller-coaster like nothing Jamie or I have ever been on.  Neither of us had ever experienced these types of emotions; the love, worry, empathy, guilt, stress, etc. which parents feel. Though she has come a very long way, the financial element is beginning to become a legitimate concern.  While the last thing Jamie and I like to do is ask for help, especially financially, we KNEW it would be an all-around challenge from the moment we found out she had ARPKD.  Now, nearly 6 weeks from Lilly's birth, the medical bills and expenses associated with driving to/from the hospital and spending every available minute with our Angel is beginning to take a significant toll. To this point, we have asked for love, support, and prayers.  Now, we extend our request and are humbled to ask for any monetary help we can receive.  While it is difficult for us to ask for, we have an incredible journey ahead of us.  Should we exceed our goal or have an abundance of support, know a contribution to Wolfson’s Children Hospital and the PKD Foundation will be made. Some statistics: Chance of getting ARPKD  1 in 40,000 births (pkdcure.com) Average cost of NICU per day  $1,200 - $3,500/night (ehow.com & foundationforprematureinfants.org) Average cost of kidney transplant  $262,900 (transplantliving.org) For more info about the disease or our journey specifically, please visit the links below: http://www.pkdcure.org/learn/arpkd http://hopeforlilliangrace.blogspot.com/","5,560",,https://fundrazr.com/cRga4,Hope for Lillian Grace,,,

"On March 23rd 1997 one of the greatest people I know entered my life.  My loving sister, Shawna and her dedicated husband, Jim gave birth to my beautiful niece named Shelby.  Just this past March 23rd 2013, she celebrated her sweet 16th birthday.  My Shelby has grown up to be a loving, dedicated and beautiful young lady. On April 3rd, 2013 I had received a devastating phone call from my sister that my only niece, Shelby, had just been diagnosed with Leukemia.  On April 4th after testing her bone marrow it was confirmed that she has Pre B A.L.L Leukemia.  Now at the time of her life where she should be worrying about boys, what clothes look best on her and if her make up is to perfection she has a battle ahead of her.  Before I got to talk to my niece, my sister told me that her only request was…NO CRYING!!!  All though she had just been told that she has been diagnosed with Leukemia, she immediately begins to think of others first.  This just goes to show what a strong, incredible young lady her parents have raised.  Shelby and her parents have a long road ahead of them with many doctor visits and two years of chemo treatment.  My brother-in-law, Jim had set up a site “the Caring Bridge” for all to walk through this journey with her and your responses have been amazing.  Her family believes that God and his Angels are protecting her and will help guide her through this.  I’m reaching out to you, family and friends to be Angels yourself and help them fight.  Due to this long road ahead of them, I’m asking for donations. Any size will help support her and her parents with unexpected expenses.  I also ask for all to continue with your prayers, specifically for a positive response to treatment, for continued strength throughout and for her wonderful doctor and nurses to be an instrument of God’s healing.  I know heaven must be echoing with your prayers for Shelby’s recovery and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.","1,345",of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/7U4i3,Supporting Shelby in her fight against Leukemia.,25,,U.S. Dollar

"My name is Alex Fortier and I'm fortunate to be a Canadian citizen,
  living in a country where medical expenses are covered by our taxes. My cousin and her 8 month old baby, Nicole, are not so fortunate. In
  the Philippines, people must either pay health insurance on a monthly
  basis or save money to pay for privatized care during medical
  emergencies. Most people (including my family) cannot afford either option. Any
  money raised in this campaign would assist Nicole in having her heart
  operation at a private hospital, where it could be scheduled
  immediately. Doctors who have studied the results of her tests
  conclude that she needs an operation urgently and having one arranged
  at an out-patient department (which would schedule the operation
  further into the future) may not help her in time. Please consider helping a child have an opportunity to live a full
  life. Every day, children all over the world are denied medical
  attention simply on the basis of fees and costs.This is a chance to
  help one such girl. When this condition is treated early in life,

"Welcome! For those who don't know me, I'm Casey. First, thank
    you for taking the time to visit my story. Second, I would like to
    point out that even if you are unable to help financially, please
    share this on any social media! All help and support is extremely
    appreciated. So what is this all about? What am I asking for help with? Why
    are you reading this? Well let’s start off with what caused me to
    have to write this all down. On August the 26th I had a stroke in the Pons region of my brain
    stem. The Pons region is responsible for communicating between your
    limbs and brain, it sends the information to your arms and legs when
    you want to do, well, anything really. The stroke was on the left
    side and affected the right side of my body. I went to Baylor Plano,
    a certified stroke center, and within an hour of arriving we had
    received the news that I had in fact suffered a stroke. I spent the
    next 5 days in the hospital. I received some incredible news on the
    3rd day--I was given a charity bed at Baylor Institute for
    Rehabilitation Frisco (BIR Frisco)! This was amazing news, this
    location is one of, if not the best rehabilitation hospitals around.
    I was blown away by this news. On September 1st, I left Baylor Plano in a wheelchair, with very
    small movements in my right hand and leg. I had double vision due to
    my left eye not working correctly, so I became a pirate for a while
    with an eyepatch. I was nervous, scared, hopeful and so very
    thankful for what was to come. When I arrived at BIR Frisco I had no
    idea what my life would be like after this. I didn't know how well I
    would recover and I was afraid. However, I knew that I could not
    give up. I knew that I had a massive support system behind me, all
    sending healing thoughts my way. I had to push on no matter the
    difficulties that lay ahead. I spent the next 14 days in Frisco. Each day I regained more and
    more use of my right side. Within 8 days I had blown the therapists
    minds. I was nearly walking again unassisted! They were more than
    amazed by my progress. I kept pushing myself each day, I told each
    and every therapist I met that I did not want a day off, I wanted
    each day to push me and make me work towards getting better. By day
    10, my therapy team was having to come up with new things for me to
    do as I had surpassed all other exercises. The other patients looked
    up to me as they saw my rapid recovery and I looked up to them as
    well. I used their support and gave it right back. I would listen to
    their stories and share my own. I gained even more support from
    people I had never known before. Day 14 came and I nearly jogged out the front door. I said my
    goodbyes to the amazing team and staff members of BIR Frisco,
    telling them I will visit soon! I knew I would have to keep these
    people in my life, they meant so much to me. It happened to be my
    father’s birthday as well, what better gift could he have received
    than having his son return home? I can't think of one. I returned to
    Baylor Plano to impress the amazing staff that got me going and
    treated me for 5 days. I interrupted their lunch (oops) but I also
    made their day. The joy I felt upon seeing them watch me walk when
    just 2 weeks earlier I could hardly stand without assistance was
    truly magical! I returned home and changed my life completely. I altered my
    diet to be healthy and free of sodium. I exercised daily to ensure I
    kept my strength. I did everything right. I felt great! I was
    getting my life back. Then comes September 26th. (26 is now my least
    favorite number) I woke on September 26th and I immediately knew. I felt it. I
    felt my entire left side completely numb. I was devastated. I was
    heartbroken. I knew what was to come. I got myself dressed and ready
    and then called my mother. Insert panic attack here. Of the 5-8
    minute phone call with my mother the only words she could understand
    were 'floor' and 'numb'. I could hear her heart breaking as well,
    her panic, her frustration. We called 911 and headed straight back
    to Baylor Plano, an all too familiar situation was once again
    entering my life. After a MRI test the doctor came in and we all know what he was
    about to say, but we weren’t quite prepared all at the same time. I
    had suffered not one, but 2 new strokes! In the same region as
    before but sitting just above the previous stroke. One on the left
    and the other on the right. How could this be? I did everything I
    was supposed to do! I was on blood thinners, I ate healthy, I
    exercised, how could I have had 2 new strokes? This completely
    devastated me. I was extremly upset after hearing this. I felt
    broken, like I wouldn't be able to do this again. How was I going to
    recover from this? I was admitted at Baylor Plano once again. Day 2 Sitting in my hospital bed, I still have function in all limbs,
    just watching TV and passing time when my case manager comes in. She
    informs us that BIR Frisco has already agreed to take me back in as
    soon as I was ready to go. This floored my family and me. We were
    shocked and amazed by this news. We knew they could get results,
    they had helped already! I spent the next week in Plano, by day 4 I
    had completely lost my left side. I could not do anything with it at
    all. I had no hope at this point, even with the amazing news, I felt
    so lost and so defeated. I began to lose hope. I cried when I knew
    no one was watching. I was so afraid that I would not recover from
    this one. All my previous work felt useless, I felt like this was
    it. Once again, I headed to Frisco in a wheelchair. This time much
    worse off. Upon arriving I was greeted by familiar faces, amazing faces,
    the people that I had worked with before were waiting for me with
    open arms. At this moment I shifted. I felt better, stronger,
    braver. I felt so loved with these people. Day 1 was the hardest
    once again, doing my evaluations, watching myself fail at all the
    tasks I had mastered not 3 weeks prior. This gave me the
    determination and strength I needed to keep pressing on. I lost the
    sadness, hopelessness and replaced it with being upbeat and
    positive. I started roaming the halls handing candy out to everyone
    I saw. I put smiles on faces, made laughs come from people who I've
    never met. I was not going to be defeated. Once again, I made sure
    to fill my days with as much therapy as possible. I spent the next 16 days in Frisco. Each day I improved, I
    regained hand and leg movement by day 4. Arm and foot movement by
    day 7. I kept pressing myself and I never gave up. I knew I couldn't
    once again. On October 21st I again said my goodbyes, this time
    promising not to return in a wheelchair but to return on my own 2
    feet and with the ability to leave on my terms! I shared both
    laughter and tears with the staff I had grown to know over this
    experience as I hugged them all goodbye. They had become a family to
    me. Each person I met made me happy and thankful. So again, what did I make this for? Why am I asking for help? I have no insurance. I was set to start working at Geico very
    shortly after I had my first injury. I was given the chance to
    switch to a later training after explaining what had happened. Then
    came my second injury and the job that I had been waiting for, was gone. I am asking for help in getting through these next few months as
    I not only adjust back into ‘normal’ life but also I diligently set
    out to find out why this has happened to me. I will need help paying
    for medical bills, for more tests , and more doctor visits as well
    as living expenses. I need any help that you are willing to give. I can never thank every person for all the support that I have
    received over these past two months but I can show them how far I
    have come and how much I care about them. I will continue to improve
    and get better. I have to, for myself, my family, and my friends. Please share this on your Facebook, Instagram, Email, anything
    you’re able to. I am asking the universe to spread this to as many
    people as possible. I want to leave you with these last thoughts. “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in getting up
    every time we fall.” - Confucius This quote has become more meaningful to me than anything I have
    seen before. I found it during my first injury on a random stroke
    support website and it struck a chord in me instantly. There are ways to spot a stroke, below is an acronym that can be
    used to help save someone’s life. Time is always of the essence, the
    faster someone can be diagnosed, the better chance they have for
    full recovery. Remember the acronym FAST: F- Face, if someones face is drooping A- Arms, if their arms are weak S- Speech, if their words are slurred or they don't make sense T- Time, time to call 911 Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I may never know
    who you are but know that I love you and I will forever be grateful
    for you.","1,290",of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/cmayfield,Helping Casey get through these difficult times.,11,,U.S. Dollar
"Jay Piggot, our amazing friend, was recently diagnosed with a rare
  and hard to treat form of cancer in the vicinity of his liver. This
  cancer, known as cholangiocarcinoma, has resulted in a relatively
  large tumour which is currently inoperable. Jay's medical team hopes
  that after an intensive round of chemotherapy, that the tumour will
  shrink sufficiently to allow surgery to remove it. Jay is a dedicated volunteer with North Shore Rescue, and serves on
  its elite helicopter rescue team as a SAR Medic. He is also a budding
  primary care paramedic with the British Columbia Ambulance Service.
  Unfortunately, even though he has worked full-time hours, he is still
  classified as part-time, and thus is not eligible for benefits, sick
  time or disability. While he is undergoing treatment and recovering,
  he will not be able to work. Given the need for chemotherapy, and the
  surgery to follow, it could be upwards of a year before he is back at work. This is where things get very tough. Jay and his wife Denise, have
  two young boys aged 6 and 9. The older of the two has recently
  received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, and requires
  significant support both financially and from his family. The loss of
  an income, no matter how temporary, will be devastating to this
  hardworking, caring family. We want to make sure that this is one
  stressor they don't need to worry about. Jay Piggot is a man who puts others first, and has saved many lives
  both in his role as a medic with North Shore Rescue, and as a
  paramedic with the ambulance service. He embodies the motto of
  ""so that others may live."" Jay has risked his own life many
  times, so that complete strangers might live and be reunited with
  their families, We, being Jay's North Shore Rescue family, would like to create a
  sizeable trust fund that can be utilized to cover family expenses,
  medical bills, and allow him to focus 100% on fighting the cancer.
  Every donation will make a difference to his outcome. He is in for the
  fight of his life, but we can all have his back. Help us, Rescue this amazing Rescuer, and donate to the Jay
    Piggot Trust Fund established through BlueShore Financial. For more information, visit www.rescuetherescuer.ca This fund is not directly associated with North Shore Rescue, and
  there is no tax receipt issued. All funds are deposited into a trust fund with Blueshore
    Financial. Three NSR members, including a professional accountant,
    will manage the discretionary trust. Disbursements will be made
    according to the wages Jay would otherwise have earned and any
    incidental costs associated with his treatment (including
    medications not covered by MSP). A further goal will be to maintain
    a contingency to cover any costs associated with alternative or
    out-of-province treatment that may be required and not covered by
    MSP. Any left over funds once Jay beats this will go towards taking
    care of Jay’s children.","108,550",of $60k goal,https://fundrazr.com/jay.piggot,Help Rescue The Rescuer,1012,,Canadian Dollar

  her scoliosis she is unable to ride her horse, Twist, except on rare
  occasions. It is her DREAM to rescue horses &
  connect them with people living with a disability (PTSD). Over time
  both horse & person will learn to regain trust, to love & to
  be loved. Typically in Canada the options for treating scoliosis are 1) wait
  and see 2) hard bracing 3) Spinal Fusion . Luna is currently on
  ""wait and see"" as the hard brace proved to be ineffective.
  The last option in Canada is SPINAL FUSION . We refuse
  to follow through with this surgery for many reasons including the
  fact that Luna may NEVER be able to RIDE TWIST again! Through research I found a Scoliosis Treatment Facility - ScoliSmart,
  in the US, who uses specialized exercise and equipment, an activity
  suit, nutrition, and natural supplements to retrain the muscle memory,
  to straighten the spine. There is NOTHING like this in CANADA. This

"Operation Push For Blood was created by Tina Kay because she was born
  with an inherited blood disorder (sickle cell disease) that has no
  cure and she needs blood often.  After needing blood and there was
  none available for 4 days she decided to make this one of her
  platforms, blood donation.   Many people don't know that blood
  contains DNA and has to genetically match in order for the person in
  need of blood to receive blood from a donor.  In laymans terms, it is
  best to receive blood from someone in your race (because more times
  than not there is a genetic match).  With blood transfusions and blood
  exchanges being common therapies for people like Tina Kay living with
  SCD, more African American blood donors are needed!  Tina Kay works
  closely with Life South Community Blood Centers who provide Alabama
  with approximately 95% of the blood in Alabama, because their
  specialty is blood and nothing else.  She's an amazing person
  according to Life South check it out http://www.lifesouth.org/donate/patient-stories/ .. Tina has teamed up with First United Community Foundation
  (501c3), the NAACP (Alabama Conference) & Summit Media Group to
  get 50,000 African Americans to donate blood by December 31, 2015. 
  This campaign is in rememberance of our forefathers who bled and died
  50 years ago for our rights during 'Bloody Sunday', we are
    asking people to donate blood or donate funds, however, both would
    be ideal! It is sad but true that the percentage of blood donated by black
  people is not filling the need, meaning more black people need to
  donate blood.  So, Tina Kay created a movement to educate, engage, and
  encourage blood donation in her community. Most times Tina
    will use her own money to host blood drives in the form of
  competitions, challenges, festivals, events, and town hall forums to
  help increase the amount of donated blood.  She works with schools,
  churches, non-profits, organizations, and events to set up blood
  drives.  She really needs your help!  Studies have found that 37% of
  the population can donate blood but only 10% donate, if you are
  reading this and you do not donate blood on a regular basis now is your chance to make a difference by donating a kind contribution. Did you know every 2 seconds someone in the US needs blood, 1
    blood donation can save the lives of 3 people, and 4.5 million
    people will need blood every year .  In order to save lives and
  provide a better quality of life for others needing blood we need your
  generous monetary donation!  You never know, it could be your child or
  you in need of blood one day! The kick off competitive festival for this campaign witll begin

  Children's Hospital in order to have a procedure done known as brain
  cooling in attempts to minimize damage caused by perinatal asphyxia.
  Noah's brain cooled for 72 hours after which time the hospital ran an
  MRI and an EEG to determine the extent of the damage. Unfortunately,
  the results came back with devastating news. Noah had suffered
  ""global damage"" to his brain. As a result the prognosis was
  grim. They said Noah would mostly likely never walk, talk, eat or even
  breathe on his own. Today, Noah has the diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic
  encephalopathy resulting in spastic quadriplegia cerebral palsy with
  athetoid movements. Noah's miracle has brought our story to all of you. Because Noah's uninsured medical costs are so high, we are unable to
  afford equipment so he can participate in the world around him. We are
  trying to fundraise for a larger TFH swing, a Axiom Endeavour Push
  Chair so he can run races with his daddy, and money to afford paying

"Liam Elder is a young and energetic 10 year old boy who is
    fighting leukemia for the second time in his young life. As
  part of his current treatment, Liam is scheduled to have a bone marrow
  transplant in December at the Sick Kids hospital in Toronto and will
  be away from home for up to 3 months. His parents must be there to
  support him. We want to help the Elder family to pay for the
  additional expense of living away from home, as well as for additional
  care for Liam’s little brother Ben. All donations will be used to
    pay for accommodations, food, childcare and any medical supplies
    needed in this incredibly difficult time. Liam was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia ( pre-B Acute Lymphatic Leukemia,
    Philadelphia Chromosome positive ) in March 2011 at the age of 6.
  The first 17 months of his 2.5 year protocol were intense. He was
  admitted to hospital for powerful and very harsh chemotherapies every
  3-4 weeks. In between these chemotherapies he was admitted many times
  for c-difficile and other bacterial/viral/fungal infections,
  pneumonia, anaphylaxis reactions to blood products, etc. At the end of
  the intense chemotherapies, he received 12 Grays of cranial radiation.
  He completed his protocol in late October 2013 and was completely
  medication free for nine months. Liam relapsed on July 17th, 2014 with the same type of cancer and
  chemotherapy began immediately. The plan was to get the cancer into
  remission and then go to Sick Kids Hospital in Toronto for a blood
  marrow or stem cell transplant. Three weeks later, while
  immune-compromised he started having some intense pains in his nose,
  and within days we noticed that part of his palate was black, a sign
  of dead tissue. The diagnosis was Mucormycosis, a rare,
  life-threatening fungal infection. Within hours he was whisked away to
  surgery to have 2/3 of his palate removed, as well as the septum in
  his nose and a nerve. Further surgeries removed a tear duct, the sinus
  cavity between his eyes, and a lot more debridements to remove
  necrotic tissue than any child should endure. Lots of x-rays, scans and MRIs were done to make sure it had not
  spread to the brain, lungs or other parts of his body. He was “lucky”
  in this regard, but the road to recovery, both physical and emotional,
  has been very hard on the entire family, as has been keeping both the
  Mucormycosis and Leukemia at bay … a VERY delicate balance indeed.
  This kept Liam in CHEO for over three months and he remains on both
  chemotherapy medications and very strong anti-fungal medications. A bone marrow donor has been found for Liam, and the
    transplant could take place in December once a conclusion
  on the fungal infection has been reached. So, the Elders are embarking
  on this journey to transplant, and the doctors, parents and Liam are
  working to understand the risks involved with everything that is going
  on. They started the pre-transplant process this past week, and the
  plan is for Liam to be admitted on December 10. Right before Christmas! With everything that they have to worry about, we want to try to make
  their lives a little easier. The family has enough on their plates
  without thinking about finances, and any donations will be deeply appreciated. Please donate and support the Elder family as they embark on
    this important journey to save Liam’s life. Thank you so much for
    your help! A note on payment methods: You do not need a PayPal account to contribute. Just look for the

"As some of you may already know, at the end of October, Corinne
    Boyd, an amazing wife, mom and grandma to five boys, was diagnosed
    with stage 4 ovarian cancer. She had a tumor removed from one of her
    ovaries and is still recovering from that intense surgery. She's
    currently waiting to be scheduled for chemotherapy treatments
    which will start sometime in the next few weeks and continue for
    about 5 months. Corinne is my mom and also one of my closest friends. She's the
  toughest woman I know but is struggling with what this battle will
  entail for her and my dad. In order to allow her the full mental
    energy she needs to fight for her life, I'd love to remove some of
    the financial burden that my parents are facing. Mom has remained positive and extremely strong throughout this whole
  ordeal. However, many of you have expressed your desire to help out
  and so I've decided to set up a donations page. My
  parents have insurance but cancer treatments are expensive even with
  insurance coverage. So the money would go towards hospital bills,
  medication, chemo treatments, etc. No amount is too small and any
  amount donated would be greatly appreciated. We'll also accept prayers
  and positive vibes :) She has an incredible support network of family and friends that have
  gone above and beyond to help these last few weeks as well. Mom, Dad
  and our entire family are so thankful for all your support and love.
  Thank you. Note to anyone who knows Corinne personally: if at all possible, I'd

"Hello and Thank You for your support! Bonjour et Merci pour
  votre support! My name is Annie Fofonoff, myself and our family are doing this
  fundraiser for my 31 year old brother, Michael Allaire nicknamed
  Mikey, who was diagnosed with PANCREATIC cancer in May 2015. Je m'appelle Annie Fofonoff, moi-même et ma familles fesons cette
  collection de fonds pour mon frère de 31 ans, Louis-André Allaire
  surnommé L.A., qui à été diagnostiquer avec le cancer du PANCREAS au
  mois de mai 2015.  Je vais premièrement donner l'histoire en Anglais,
  et si vous DEFILEZ VERS LE BAS, vous le verrez en FRANCAIS. Mikey is a 31 year old single dad who was diagnosed with pancreatic
  cancer in May 2015. He was immediately put on a feeding tube to bring
  down the swelling of his pancreas in order to go through whipple
  surgery. Near the end of July 2015, they were finally ready for
  surgery! Mikey went into surgery thinking ""Yay! I'll finally be
  able to eat!""  He told me his first meal was going to be my mom's
  famous Fajitas closely followed by some good ol' BBQ!  This week, that
  hope was crushed, the fajita dinner he's been waiting 2 months to
  have, is now a distant memory. When he came out of surgery, the doctors and our mom had to tell him
  that they couldn't finish the surgery as planned because the cancer
  had metasticized. The cancer has spread from his pancreas to his
  liver. My brother is devasted and worried not only about himself, but
  about his 14 year old daughter, Amygaël. Amygaël loves her dad and cannot imagine her life without him.  She
  says that he is her rock!  He's been the only one she could count on
  and he's always managed to provide for her.  As for Mikey, he feels
  that Amygaël is his reason to live.  He loves her deeply and will do
  anything for her.  He would like to make sure his daughter is in the
  right hands should something happen, he has begun the process for
  this!! This fundraiser, is to help him cover costs.  In Mikey's true nature,
  he is hopeful and looking into international treatments not available
  in Canada.  He has found a promising one.  Funding will be going to
  housing and living costs for him and his daughter, as he cannot work.
   He also wishes to try to make sure Amygaël has a chance at a
  post-secondary education.  And, if there's anything left over and he
  medically can travel, he would like to take his daughter to a theme
  park, something like Marineland. Michael lived in Calgary, Alberta
  with his two sisters, his Mom and step Dad till the age of 15 years
  old, thus a visit in Calgary would be on his wish list to visit with
  his family, since he now resides in Quebec. Please keep him and his daughter in your thoughts and prayers.
  Despite the fact that he has faced many challenges, Mikey has NEVER
  given up and he has always kept positive. On behalf of Mikey, Amygaël and our family, Thank You so much for
  your thoughts, prayers, time, donations and support. Love, Annie :) L.A.est un père qui a 31 ans et qui a été diagnostiquer avec le
  cancer du pancréas au mois de mai 2015.  Il a immédiatement été gavé
  avec un tube pour la nourriture pour être capable d'avoir la chirurgie
  Whipple. Finalement, à la fin du moi de juillet, il était prêt pour
  l'opération.  L.A. est entré dans l'opération en pensant ""Youpi!
   Je vais être capable de manger!"".  Il m'a dit que pour son
  premier repas, il voulait les Fajitas de notre mère, suivit par du
  BBQ.  Cette semaine, son espoir c'est effondré et le souper de fajita
  qu'il attendais depuis deux mois, n'est devenu qu'un souvenir. Quand il est sorti de la chirurgie, notre mère et les docteurs ont du
  lui apprendre  qu'ils n'ont pas été capable de compléter la chirurgie
  car son cancer avait des métastases.  Le cancer est maintenant aussi
  dans son foie.  L.A. était bouleverser et non-seulement inquiet de
  soi-même, mais aussi pour sa petite fille de 14 ans, Amygaël. Amygaël adore sont petit papa et ne peut imaginer sa vie sans
  lui.   Comme elle le dit toujours, son papa a toujours été le seule à
  être là pour elle,"" il est ma sécurité"".    Il a toujours
  subvenue à tout ses besoins possible.  Et pour lui, elle est sa raison
  de vivre!  Il veut aussi s'assuré qu'elle serait entre bonne main, si
  j'amais le pire arriverais et a commencé les démarches pour ceci.  Il
  adore sa petite fille Amygaël et ferait tout pour elle. Comme L.A. fait d'habitude, il essaye de trouver de l'espoir.  Il
  cherche les traitements internationaux qui sont non-disponibles au
  Canada, et il a trouvé un qui est prometteur.  Les dons amassé seront
  aussi utiliser pour aider avec les frais medicaux non couvert et les
  coûts de la vie, vue qu'il ne peut travailler.  Alors, un de ses
  désires serait qu'Amygaël aille l'opportunitée d'aller au
  études postsecondaire.  S'il reste un peu de sous, et qu'il puisse
  voyager, il aimerait apporter sa fille à un parc comme Marineland.  Il
  n'a jamais été lui même!  Louis-Andre a demeurer à Calgary, Alberta,
  jusqu'à l'âge 15 ans avec ses deux sœurs, sa Mère et son beau-père,
  alors même une visite à Calgary serais géniale, car il réside au
  Quebec présentement. S'il-vous-plaît, gardez Louis-André et sa petite fille Amygaël dans
  vos pensées et prières.  Malgré tous les défis que mon frère a eu, il
  n'a jamais abandonner et il a toujours rester optimiste et plein d'espoir. De la part de Louis-André ""L.A"", Amygaël et notre famille,

"Click HERE for Summer Hats Click HERE for Bags & Totes Click HERE for Barefoot Sandals,
    Cuffs, and more! Click HERE to see everything!!! Hey There!  My name is Dori Smith, or Granny Smith for short!  I live
  on a small farm in Ramona, CA with my granddaughter, my roommie, and a
  bunch of animals. To get right to the point, I am going through a new
  treatment for a rare and deadly autoimmune disease, and I can't afford
  the medication. So I'm making home-made Summer Hats, Bags & Totes,
  Barefoot Sandals, and lots of other awesome and stylish things in
  exchange for donations. I hope you will read on! You see, I have a disease called SCLERODERMA, (watch a video about
  Scleroderma here: Scleroderma Info ).  For the past 9 years, my
  rheumatologists told me that scleroderma is progressive, there is no
  cure, and I'd probably die young from not being able to breathe. Yuck!
  Thanks for the hope! But I'm excited because I have much to hope for!  New research in
  immunotherapy is very promising, and while it's not a perfect cure
  (yet), it promises to make my quality of life BETTER. I'll take BETTER!!!  Better means having the energy to do fun things
  with my granddaughter, like volunteering at her AWANAS meetings.  
  Better means being able to drive her to youth group meetings at church
  on Friday nights, and going to church myself!  Better hopefully means
  being around here on earth longer, so I can be at her wedding, and
  help her with her children.  I'm all she has.  Better... is... good. So nine months ago, I found a doctor who specializes in scleroderma
  immunotherapy, Dr. Al Franco in Riverside, CA (Check out his video
  here: Arthritis Center of Riverside .)
   After a ton of testing, I embarked on the 1-2 year treatment
  protocol.  In November, my biomarkers showed that the treatment was
  starting to work!!!  Since then, I am very slowly improving.  Whoo-hoo!!! The bad news is, the medications are expensive, and insurance only
  covers part of it.  I am on disability, and I am also raising my
  granddaughter Jana on my own, so it's just a fact of life now... I
  simply can't pay for the treatment on my own.  There are 5 medications
  that I take each day that cost nearly $400 per month, which a
  wonderful friend has been helping me pay for.  But she doesn't have
  much money either.  So by helping me, she is hurting herself. That's
  not good. So I came up with a plan.  I thought, ""What can I still do to
  make some extra money?""  I am an excellent knitter and
  crocheter...  and I make the fancy, most difficult things too (I'm
  also pretty humble about it... LOL!)  But what can I make quickly?
   Usually my knitting takes me a long time to complete. But, WAIT!
   HATS!  So I decided to make hats in exchange for donations, and
  hopefully make enough to continue my treatment.  I sure can't stop the
  treatment now that it is making a difference! Since I started the hats in December, I've made enough money to cover
  my medications every month!  So thank you all so much!!! But I still have more than a year to go, so will you please help me
  with a donation?  That will pay for the yarn and the shipping, and
  leave about $20 for my medicines. Great idea, huh?  But only if you
  can help! You will not only be helping a grandma (and a granddaughter!) that
  truly needs it, but you will also receive a beautifully hand-made
  item that will look so great on your little ones! (Or on you!!!)  I
  have over 600 styles to choose from, for babies, kids, teens, women,
  and men.  I even have hats and outfits for dogs and cats!!! LOL!
   You've got to see these here: Click HERE for Pet Stuff! After you donate, be sure to send me an e-mail with your item choice
    to GrannySmithGifts@gmail.com . I'll get back to you
  as soon as possible to let you know when I'll be starting your custom,
  quality, hand-made item, made out of high quality cotton yarn for to
  keep you cool in the summer. Thank you again for your donation, and May God Bless You for helping
  me to get better!   And please, don't forget to share this page with
  everyone you know!  The more people who see it, the more successful

"My name is Syed, and recently I learned about a significant
    problem that affects millions of children and their families across
    our country: the lack of access to adequate and affordable mental
    health care. This problem is especially important to address in
    children because early detection and treatment of mental illness,
    increases the chance of flourishment exponentially. We can normalize
    the lives of children who are struggling with mental illness, and we
    can assist them in becoming productive individuals in our society. About eighteen months ago, I had the opportunity to speak with a
    pediatrician regarding access to mental health care in children and
    adolescents. During this meeting, I learned how essential access to
    healthcare is for the early detection of childhood illness and the
    initiation of treatment. After that meeting, I spoke with dozens
    parents, therapists, and doctors, who all confirmed that this
    problem is real and a solution is desperately needed. I put
    assembled a team of five pediatric therapy experts and a technology
    engineer who has previously built healthcare technology solutions.
    Together, we developed an innovative digital platform where families
    and children from across the country can access quality and
    affordable treatment with trained certified therapists. After an
    initial intake, the therapists would provide services on the online
    platform, which will be very user-friendly and easy to navigate. The
    most important part about our technology would be that it would analyze rating scores by parents and clinicians, and
    generate “best practice” treatment plans for new patients with
    similar conditions. As the database grows, the 'smarter' it will become. The main goal of this project is to improve access to current
    and relevant treatment that will improve the quality of the lives of
    these children and their families. Since, this is an online
    platform, we had significantly reduced costs by not needing to have
    physical clinic locations. Currently, there are nine members of the
    Enable My Child project and the mission is deeply personal to each
    one of us; and we are all working on this project without financial
    compensation; which is expected to continue to be true for at least
    the next nine months. Roughly 95% of your contribution will go into
    advertising our service to parents around the country. The remaining
    5 percent will be used for operating costs including maintaining
    servers, legal fees, etc. We need to drastically increase awareness of this issue and
    bring this program to the millions of families and children who need
    a solution. This program could very well be the difference between a
    happy healthy child and tragedy. Please give as generously as
    possible, but, no amount that is too small. Please continue the work

"Thyroid problems are one of the common problems in the world today.
  Millions suffer from the effects of underactive thyroids, and simple
  all natural supplements taken responsibly can mitigate the effects
  cheaply and inexpensively without the need for costly medical care. But consumers today are presented with a challenge in knowing
  who to trust. Unscrupulous vendors can spike their supplements with
  dangerous levels of hormones, or sell products with substandard and
  uncontrolled additives. Additionally, these products, driven by
  manufacturers concerned solely about profit, generally use desiccated
  glands from factory farms, where the animals are treated cruelly, and
  fed with high levels of antibiotics, which can damage the thyroid and
  lead to suboptimal glands. The chemicals, additives, and ingredients
  in their products are hidden behind cries of proprietary technology,
  and consumers are left with nobody to trust other than anonymous
  reviews on internet forums. Our project aims to change all of that. With your help, we are
  going to start a product of which everyone can be confident and proud.
  We are going to manage the complete life cycle of our animals, from
  the farm to the final production of the desiccated extract. The
  animals will be treated humanely and allowed to run in the fields and
  build up a natural resistance to infection to ensure an optimal
  thyroid. The workers will be paid a fair wage, in line with Fair Trade practices. And most importantly, our entire production will be open for
  inspection. We will publish every single ingredient going into our
  product, and give you, our sponsors, guided tours of our facilities so
  you can verify that what you are getting is all natural and free of
  dangerous additives. Does this mean someone could copy us and make a competing
  product? It probably does, and if they do, we would consider this
  project a success. Our idea is for a movement towards openness in
  health and trust with our customers. Drug companies would have you
  believe that more regulation is the only way to safe health. In
  reality, trust of federal regulatory agencies responsible for managing
  these companies is at a historic low. People around the world are realizing that naturopathy and
  prevention through the use of natural remedies has a place in their
  life, just as traditional allopathic medicines do. It is time to show
  that a new model has genuine benefits to global health.","17,668",of $100k goal,https://fundrazr.com/81B7oa,Thyroid for Life,134,,U.S. Dollar

"Help Eddy To Fund For His Hearing Aid Eddy Chong is 51 years, deaf and blind since 32,
  was a successful engineer until he lost his hearing and vision due to
  severe dengue fever. Soon after, he lost his job and his family as

  tour guide, organizing trips around Asia for the blind. Eddy is also
  the President of Blind Empowerment Society of
  Selangor , a society to empower the blind to ""get out of the
  dark"". He needs the hearing aid to sustain his livelihood which
  is unaffordable. Read all about Eddy below. ""Over The Hills & Valleys"" a story by Eddy Chong I WAS 32 and at the peak of my career as an engineer with a Kuala
  Lumpur-based construction firm when a deadly bout of dengue
  hemorrhagic fever changed my life drastically. My colleague, Mr. T,
  contracted dengue fever about the same time as me. Unfortunately, he
  developed complications and succumbed to dengue shock syndrome. I
  almost lost my life, too. I had high fever which stretched over two
  weeks. I suffered severe vomiting and internal bleeding and was
  hospitalized for about a month. There were other complications. Due to
  the high fever, the cone cells or photoreceptor cells in the retina
  were affected, resulting in loss of vision. The cochlear hair cells in
  my ears were also damaged by the raging fever; it left me with hearing
  impairment in BOTH ears. I can still remember what the doctor told
  me: “Eddy, you have to hope for the best and prepare for the
  worst.” I cried when I heard those words. I recovered after
  months of recuperation. In fact, it was one whole year before I could
  get on my feet again. However, I was unable to return to work due to
  severe vision loss and hearing impairment. It was a devastating blow
  for me. I had lost my job which I loved so much. How was I to support
  my family? My wife of two years was expecting our first child at that
  time. I approached more than 80 companies for job interviews but none
  was successful. I even tried to find work as a general cleaner and was
  willing to accept a low pay, but nobody wanted to take me in. There was one particular incident which remains etched in my memory.
  One day, I found work as a dishwasher at a coffeeshop near my house,
  but it didn’t last more than an hour. Some customers ticked off my
  ladyboss. “How could you hire a blind man to work in your shop? You
  should just provide him with some food or meals,” they chided her. My
  boss felt really embarrassed and I was relieved of my duties. I felt
  so useless. No matter how hard I tried, nothing seemed to turn out
  right. I was saddened by how some people view the disabled. I wasn’t
  asking for handouts. I was more than willing to work to support my family. My wife gave birth to a baby girl who brought much joy to our home.
  Eventually I found work as a masseur in a massage centre in
  Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur. Life was hard. I had two to three customers
  a week. I could barely earn enough to support my family. There was one
  day when I waited until midnight for a customer to drop by, but I was
  to be disappointed. I had only 40 sens in my pocket. How was I to go
  home? I headed to the nearest bus stop with my white cane.In the
  stillness of the night, dark thoughts played in my head and all the
  hurts and unfairness of life came crashing down on me. Tears rolled
  down my cheeks as I ploughed on. “Why me?” I asked God. “I can’t bear
  this hardship. I just want to work and feed my family, but here I am,
  with barely enough to feed myself.” It was about 3 in the morning when
  a taxi pulled up in front of the bus stop where I sat. “Why are you
  crying? Did something happen to you?” enquired the kindly cabbie. I
  told him that I had no money to go home. He sent me to my home in
  Puchong and did not charge me a sen. The next few years were a big struggle for my young family,
  financially. The strain affected my marriage and eventually my wife
  left me and took our little daughter with her. I waited for months for
  my wife to return home. All hope was gone when she eventually filed
  for divorce as I could no longer provide for the family. I was at the
  lowest point of my life. I had lost my sight, my hearing, my job, and
  now, my family. I was overwhelmed by a sense of hopelessness. I
  felt like the last ray of light had gone out of my life. Many dark days followed and depression set in. I was plaqued by
  suicidal thoughts. I remember the days when I wondered around the
  neighbourhood, aimlessly. I had nothing left. Nothing to live
  for. I was angry with myself, and with the world at large. But
  God is never too far away, and soon enough, he sent a friend my way
  whom gave me lots of encouragements. Today, 14 years after the dengue
  fever that robbed me of my health, I have found a new purpose in life
  – by helping others. I lead and guide the blind and deaf on trips to
  various hospitals, clinics, government offices, banks, airports and
  even hotels. I can travel independently anywhere and have no problems
  taking public transport, be it buses, the LRT or monorail. I love to travel and explore new places. I have organised tours for
  the blind to neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and
  Singapore. I have also led tours for the blind that cover the length
  and breadth of the country, from Langkawi in the north to Johor in the
  South, and even to the East Coast states.","1,880",of $3.9k goal,https://fundrazr.com/eddychong,Eddy (Deaf & Blind) Needs New Hearing Aid,17,,U.S. Dollar
"In case you don't know me, I am a single 71
  year old artist living on James Island in Charleston SC. I have a son,
  daughter-in-law and two grandsons closeby who light up my life, as do
  my other two children elsewhere. I used to love to dance and do yoga and
  ride horses, and play ball with my grandsons, among other things I no
  longer can do. Now I can't walk without a cane, and do so painfully--
  I had a total hip replacement in June of 2014 by a well thought of
  surgeon, who cut the gluteus medius tendon to accomplish the surgery,
  but failed to reattach it. I awoke in excruciating pain, which never
  left me, and has alleviated only a little. My limp became the
  ""Trendelenberg Gait"",  which I had to go to another doctor
  to have identified, but still mistakenly thought to be caused by a
  torn tendon. Months passed before I got this far, and the
  original surgeon led me out of the state a for a repair, so by the
  time I had a repair surgery, the tissue had degenerated and was
  irreparable. However, the surgeon at Duke who tried to repair it told
  me that the tendon had been left in a severed state,cut, not
  reattached to the bone as it should have been. I only have 5 months left to file a legal
  procedure to request reimbursement for my injury. I have found out
  about a procedure which uses a fiber to interface between a tendon and
  bone such as my situation is, but it is not available in the US. This
  procedure should render me in possession of many of the faculties I
  have lost. Reparations could facilitate this repair for me, but for
  the legal proceding to be initiated, I have to pay a medical expert,
  someone in the orthopedic surgery field, to go over my extensive
  medical records and vouchsafe that I have a valid complaint. I do not have the total of $4000 which the
  attorney needs to put in an escrow account. I am asking for help to

"Hi all 10 years ago, at the age of 34 I collapsed on the floor in my
    living room in the UK. I was rushed off to hospital and after many
    lengthy tests and lots of pain I was diagnosed with low grade
      carcinoid tumor . Having being an extremely fit young person, training in swimming
    and leading a healthy, outgoing life this came as a big shock to me
    and my loved ones. This was devastating , as I had to give up so
    much of the healthy things I enjoy in life like travelling and sport. At this stage the medical industry had no treatment for my type
    of cancer. The only way was to operate and remove the tumors. I was born with a fused kidney and this kidney was 80% covered
    in carcinoid tumors.  The operation was a success even though I now
    only have 20% kidney function. The doctors were surprised that I
    survived after giving me the devastating news that I wasn’t going to
    make it. I fought to survive and was victorious, however the
    struggle hasn’t ended. I led a normal life and started to enjoy life again. At the age
    of 38 I was in severe pain again and back in hospital. They had to
    operate and they removed lymph nodes that had grown in that same
    area again. At the age of 39 the cancer resurfaced in my eye I was in severe
    pain .They had to operate again! As the tumor was on the muscle of
    my eye they could only de bulk as to remove the whole tumor would be
    detrimental to the eye. Living like this is no way to live a normal life. I am in
    constant stress, never mind the day to day stresses. Having lived in
    the UK for the past seventeen and a half years I decided to go back
    to South Africa with my fiancée. Ever since living in South Africa my eye has flared up every
    year for the past four years. I have been in and out of state
    hospitals, as we are not on medical insurance (due to my
    pre-existing condition - i was unable to qualify for medical
    insurance). The treatment was just anti-biotics and this treatment
    thus far has not really led anywhere and has just helped in the
    interim and hasn’t got rid of the carcinoid tumors. I’ve tried
    starting my own business, but as you  know starting a new business
    takes a lot of effort and time and with my struggle it has been near
    to impossible to keep it a float I then decided to go the natural route as the medical industry
    was not solving anything. I started to treat myself with cannabis
    oil. It wasn’t a guarantee but our last resort. It seemed to be
    helping especially for the pain. My eye did flare up in the past
    year and I just stayed at home and treated myself naturally with the
    cannabis oil. It was successful and my eye went down. Having the medical history I have we have been told that to
    conceive a child would be highly impossible. All of a sudden a
    miracle happened and my wife fell pregnant. We were overwhelmed with
    such joy that we were blessed with such a miracle. Our baby girl is 5 months old now and I am still living with
    severe pain. Recently the pain was too much to tolerate and I was
    rushed off to hospital. We had scans done and to our devastation the
    results were not good. The carcinoid tumors are now on my liver,
    bulk masses are around my lower spine and groin area as well as the
    remaining ones behind both my eyes. I thankfully have an excellent oncologist; Dr Marais has now
    informed me that in the last two years cancer researchers have found
    treatment for carcinoid tumors. This is the best news I have ever
    heard. To be able to live without this disease would be a dream come
    true! Dr Marais has informed us that the treatment is so successful
    that it has even healed some patients completely. The treatment is a hormone injection that I have to have
    administered every month. The cost of one of these injection is
    approximately   R20 000. Medical insurance does not cover this and
    it is not guaranteed through a state hospital. I may even have to
    travel to Pretoria from Durban for numerous tests to get the treatment. Having my own business that is bringing in a very low income
    does not help. We are struggling to get by just with day to day
    living costs. At the moment each day is a struggle. I am on morphine
    for pain as the pain is just so severe, this has made me bed ridden
    and unable to provide for my family. My greatest dream would be to
    see my daughter, Savannah walk her first steps and to be able to
    reach all her milestones with her, I would really appreciate any
    monetary aid from anyone that is reading this and who is able to
    assist me in reaching my dreams.","3,861",of $5k goal,https://www.realp2p.com/619sT6,Miles for Myles,39,,U.S. Dollar
"I have a rare disease called Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS). It affects
  only one in a million people worldwide and I don't want to be that
  special anymore with such an insidious disease. SPS is progressive
  with no cure but there is a trial for a stem cell transplant that
  might turn out to be the cure for this disease. SPS has caused painful stiffening of the body cauisng me to fall
  several times injuring my face and back, which started when I was 27.
  Now the stiffening has progressed to uncontrollable spasms that have
  lasted for hours sometimes and have been almost daily. The spasms now
  affect my entire trunk and legs and made it that I couldn't even sit
  up or even hold my neck. I have been bedridden since October 31, 2013
  and have difficulty breathing during the spasms or when I am stuck on
  my back in bed. I have failed multiple treatments and after my hospitalization in
  October my doctor gave up on me. At another hospital in November,
  doctors had no idea what to do with me and I went without treatment
  until almost June with my symptoms getting worse and losing all my
  abilities to care for myself. When I tried to make appointments for my
  condition with new doctors, clinics refused to see me. After going back to the Cleveland Clinic, despite them missing my
  diagnosis years ago, and seeing a new doctor I began to get better
  with an increase in medications, but the damage of all those months
  without treatment was already done. I will be traveling back and forth
  every month to Cleveland for a 2 week period to do plasmapheresis to
  clean my blood from the harmful antibodies of this disease. It only
  works in about 20% of us and even if it does work for me, to do this
  every month is as much a burden as doing dialysis. It would even get
  worse to travel 2.5 hours just one way when winter comes. Even though there is a potential cure, my insurance will not cover it
  as it is experimental. The stem cell transplant trial is based out of
  Seattle with a $400,000 deposit to even begin the trial. It is
  also being done in Denver and is much cheaper there. I hope to get a
  spot in Denver due to cost and distance. Before SPS, I was living my life working at the Social Security
  Administration helping those who were disabled too. Such irony that I
  became like some of my worst claimants such as those who were
  terminal. Once the SPS started at 27, I lost much of my life. I used
  to enjoy traveling all over the country going to museums, conventions,
  etc. meeting actors, diplomats and politicians, journalists, etc., but
  it was my last trip in 2007 that I lost all my independence as I fell
  on my face on the pavement in Houston and then I later fell getting
  off the escalator in my hotel hitting my head. I was by myself and was
  never able to walk the same though I can't walk at all now after what
  happened in 2013. I was no longer able to cook or bake for myself and
  I'm a great cook and I couldn't go to parks to enjoy nature anymore as
  well. I was an amateur photographer and can't enjoy that either and
  that's why I loved going to my local museum as well as traveling to
  art events in other cities too. I am a fighter and refuse to give up hope. Please help me raise the
  money needed so I can have that stem cell transplant. Let's help me
  beat this nasty disease and get my life back! Please, please, please
  do what you can to help me even if all you can afford is a $5
  donation. It all adds up. I am begging you all to help me get back to
  the happy person I once was who was able to help those less fortunate.
  Even though I am not able to get around I still help others to my own
  detriment and I am trying to focus on getting better but I can't stop
  helping others. So once again help me get this transplant so I can
  enjoy life and help others in a safer mine that won't cause me to keep deteriorating. I have fought so hard that my story has made it to several online
  news carriers including CNN.com as well as local TV interview on a NBC
  affliate.

  I've gotten to know named Patty Brandt who
  really needs your help. What: Patty is on the waiting list for a double lung
  transplant! This is an incredible answer to prayer. Back Story: Patty Brandt has end stage severe
  Emphysema and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). For those
  of you who aren't medically minded, her lungs only work a fraction of
  how they're suppose to work. She has such a hard time breathing she
  needs on oxygen all day every day just to breath. Even while on oxygen
  she can only walk a short distance before she needs to stop and catch
  her breath. Patty underwent tons of tests and exams under the care of the Lung
  Transplant team of physicans at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in
  Pittsburgh, PA. She has been told she will be placed on the lung
  transplant list as long as she get some minor dental work and gains
  10lbs by December 1st. *She has been given the ok by the transplant team to begin
      fundraising to cover the cost of the transplant and follow-up care. Why is Patty fundraising? Isn't this type of thing covered by health Insurance? Even if you have insurance, there are out of pocket expenses
    associated with the transplanted and continued follow up care.
    Expenses include but are not limited to: Co-pays for medications and office visits (this
    alone will be $1,000's/month) Insurance premiums and deductibles Transportation costs and parking related costs Lodging and meals Even with Medicare, the out of pocket expenses related to getting a     double lung transplant will cost tens of thousands of dollars. Why consider helping Patty? Patty is not a perfect person and no one is, but there is one person
  who is rooting harder than anyone else for Patty. Her name is Kayla.
  She is the biological granddaughter of Patty and her husband Rick.
  Kayla's dad passed away and her mother was unable to care for Kayla.
  Not wanting to see their granddaughter enter into foster care, Patty
  and Rick legally adopted their granddaughter Kayla. They opened up
  their home and changed Kayla's life for the better. Patty made a promise to Kayla that she would see her through
  graduation if not longer. Why support Patty? So Patty can keep her promise to Kayla!! Please consider helping Patty pay their medical bills and continue to
  take care of thier granddaughter whom they love with their whole heart! This is where YOU come in: Give a one time tax
  deductible donation of $3, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 or whatever
  God tugs on your heart strings to give. *All donations are secure via paypal. 100% of the donated amount goes

"A few years ago I learned of identical twins, Freddie and Louie's
  story. Two healthy identical twins who would go on to be diagnosed
  with a ultimately fatal neurological disease ""Battens disease"" Batten disease is a fatal, inherited disorder of the nervous system
  that typically begins in childhood. Early symptoms of this disorder
  usually appear between the ages of 5 and 10 years, when parents or
  physicians may notice a previously normal child has begun to develop
  vision problems or seizures. In some cases the early signs are subtle,
  taking the form of personality and behavior changes, slow learning,
  clumsiness, or stumbling. Over time, affected children suffer
  cognitive impairment, worsening seizures, and progressive loss of
  sight and motor skills. Eventually, children with Batten disease
  become blind, bedridden, and demented. Batten disease is often fatal
  by the late teens or twenties. Freddie and Louie Dawkins are the only known twins in the world with
  this rare form of a rare disease. Born perfectly healthy in 2005, they
  became autistic, blind and recently developed epilepsy. When they were
  diagnosed in 2009, doctors said that without major advancements in
  medical science, there was no hope, no treatment and no cure. Having two young children myself this story really touched me. I
  cannot even begin to imagine the pain and anguish that their parents,
  Sarah and Andrew have had to go through over the years. Imagine being
  told your healthy babies are blind, autistic…and told they will die.
  Before You. On 21/05/16 I ran tough mudder in honour of Freddie, Louie
  and their parents Sarah and Andrew. In a hope to raise money for more
  research in to this horrible disease which hopefully one day will lead

"Hello. We are seeking your help with covering the ongoing medical
  expenses for 9-year-old Zion Knowles, who had a successful Bone Marrow
  Transplant to treat Leukemia. Our daughter Zion was only 4 years old when she was diagnosed
  with Pre-B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) on June 25th, 2012. She began chemotherapy treatment on July 2nd, 2012 at a Children's
  Hospital in Miami, Florida and soon went into remission. We were faced
  with many trials and life-threatening situations from the start of
  Zion’s treatment. She suffered through pancreatitis, seizures,
  amnesia, and hallucination, requiring her to be admitted into ICU for
  about a month. Through God we overcame them. Zion continued her chemotherapy until
  May 2013, when we discovered that she had a relapse and the leukemia
  had returned. At that point, doctors advised us that Zion’s best
  option was to receive a bone marrow transplant. Zion received a
  stem-cell transplant on November 19th, 2013. Soon after the transplant, Zion developed Graft Versus Host Disease
  (GVHD), which resulted in lots of side effects including itching,
  inflammation, and abdominal pains. She also had some burn (skin
  darkening) from the radiation treatment she received prior to
  transplant. She remained in hospital for 4 months during this period
  of her treatment. Based on results, the procedure was a success. Zion iwas on
  medication and insulin to manage diabetes and high blood pressure, but
  it only lasted whie she was on all of the other medication. A few months after the transplant Zion developed a condition called
  ascites, which is collection of fluid in the abdomen. The doctors had
  to insert a catheter to allow the fluid to drain, while restricting
  her from eating, so that it could heal. Through all of that, Zion was
  brave and understanding, all while remaining positive and faithful.
  Zion eventually recovered from the ascites after being restricted from
  eating for a few weeks, whie getting her nutrients via IV. Zion soon became well enough to make trips home to The Bahamas and
  celebrated her 7th birthday at home. Zion needed to have some dental work done due to the severity of her
  teeth decay. An unfortunate result of the chemotherapy and countless
  medication she has been on over the first 3 years of her treatment. It
  was necessary due to the high risk of infection she faces, as a
  consequence of her immune-suppressed state. These were all done out of
  pocket, due to her ineligibility for health insurance. Eventually, Zion was given the all clear to return home for good and
  has been back in the Bahamas since August 2015. Due to her immune
  system not being as strong as it should, she has had several bouts of
  infections and common illnesses which affect her a bit longer than it
  would most kids. Still, Zion has been a trooper throughout! Zion returned to school for the first time in 4 years this past
  September. She was so excited to make new friends and to get back to
  doing what ""normal kids do"". We pray that the toughest times are behind us and while she is doing
  MUCH better, there are ongoing expenses to cover. As we are without health insurance coverage, we have to pay
      for all of Zion's medical expenses out of pocket. These include but are not limited to: hospital visits, medication,
  immunizations and physician visits. With this in mind, we continue to seek your assistance with covering
  these constant expenses. Donations are welcomed and appreciated. No
  amount you give would be too little, and no act of compassion would go unnoticed. We believe that Zion's journey will inspire others who may be
  experiencing their own struggle. Each day we are able to share with
  Zion is a blessing, and with your help, we may share many more. Thank

"Jordan Lopez Jordan Lopez Cordero is 25 years old and has been living in the
    community of Playa Guiones, Nosara in Costa Rica for 12 years.
    Jordan is a well known person in our town; always dedicated to his
    work with a passion to help his fellow coworkers, friends, family
    and clients. In the beginning of 2012 Jordan started to have problems with
    his heart, something called Cardiac Arythmias, very difficult to
    manage. Different exams of the heart have been made but the root of
    the problem has never been found. On certain occasions the episodes
    have been so severe that he would lose consciousness, followed by
    chest pains and strong tachycardia. In the past months these episodes have been more and more
    constant which has caused friends and family to become very worried
    about his health and well being. Costa Rican heart specialists have
    started an intense research of Jordan's heart. Due to his severe
    condition Jordan can hardly do any of his daily activity making it
    very hard for him to livea restfull life. Our goal is to help Jordan
    get back to living his normal peacefull life away from having this
    constant strees and scare in his head. He wold like to get back to
    work, play sports like soccer and surfing, doing what he most loves
    and is passionate about. It is very important to us to have  our
    friend here for many more years; strong and healthy with everything
    he is. To get there though, there is a lot to be done. Still, Jordan
    has more tests and exams to go through, many days at hospitals and
    traveling from Nosara to San Jose. We all know that all type of
    heart problems are very serious and surgery always comes with great
    risk. We want to make sure that he gets the best help he can before
    his well being gets worse, which is where we ask for your help. Transportation and hospital bills are very high and we are
    reaching out to get funds to make sure he can get the help he needs.
    Any type of financial contribution will be highly appreciated. It is
    a long process so hopefully, step by step, we can get Jordan back
    with us living the life the way he wants. Pura vida","1,810",of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/d1DI51,Jordan's medical expenses (Heart),9,,U.S. Dollar
"Hello my name is Teresa I am 48 years young. I live in Flint MI. I was dignosed with ovarian cancer in July of 2012. I was given
    a 30% chance at 5 years, I have had debulking surgery and done 6
    treatments of Carbo platinum and Taxtiere chemo. I was N.E.D. (No
    Evidence of Disease) until late 2014. I started chemo in Spring of
    2015 again and did 4 treatments of Carbo Platinum and Gemzar,
    however, my platelets dropped too low so I could not do anymore
    chemo. I have since decided to try and cure or treat my cancer
    myself as I am sure the chemotherapy will kill me. I had a pet scan
    and CA125 run in August of 2016. I have multiple tumors, 7 to be
    exact throughout my body and it is in my lymph nodes.  I have been
    using many natural cures to continue my life here, which
  is very expensive. The bottled water, vitamins, food, household
  and other bills, the list goes on. I also need repairs for my vehicle,
   yet I am falling behind on everything as it is. I need a filtration
  system for my home as the water here in Flint is not safe to use, so I
  have the constant cost of bottled water. Now we have lost our water
  credits so we will have the most expensive unusable water. I never thought I would be in this position to have to ask from
    strangers, but no one ever does. If you can find it in your heart to
    help I will be eternally grateful, and if not thank you for your
    time and please share that others may be able to help me. Thank you,

"Help Judit to fight against a very destructive  Chronic Lyme Disease! Hello, welcome to my page!  I would like to ask your help. I am a 29 years
  old woman and live in Hungary.  I have been suffering from severe
  chronic (Late stage) Lyme Disease and co-infections(babesiosis,
  bartonella, mycoplasma fermentans, candidiasis) for 9 years.  I have
  been worn down by the various types of pain persisting for years. I was about 5-6 years old when I was bitten by some ticks. My
  Lyme-disease was not diagnosed then.  When I was  19 years old there
  was a sudden change in my condition: severe pain appeared in both of
  my hands and arms, which was followed by many other symptoms later
  like  stiff neck,  stiff spine, sciatica, eye ache and
  light-sensitivity, ear ache and sound - sensitivity, heavy digesting
  system-problems like gastric ulcer, chronic reflux-GERD, chronic IBS
  (bowel inflammation), chronic fatigue syndrome , depression, panic
  attack, tremor, trepidation, insomnia, asthma, arthritis,  head-ache,
  systematic candidiasis. These are all Lyme – symptoms, but doctors
   didn’t realize. They didn’t know what to do with me because all my
  evidences were negative. They gave me steroid in spite of the negative
  results of my autoimmune test . I was diagnosed only in 2010 with
  Chronic Lyme-disease and co-infections when my Western Blot-test was
  positive. Unfortunately, it was too late. I am in the third stage,
   which is the last, the most severe one.  Also had a positive
  Pyroluria test in october, 2014. I should cure this, too.  I haven ’t
  been able to walk for 7 years  and use my hands normally for 9 years
  because of the sharp neurological pain. I am not able to lift even a
  glass without pain. My neck also aches and extremely defatigable. I am
  very short-sighted, but I can not wear my glasses beacuse of my strong
  eye-pain.I am not able to walk downstairs from the flat where I live
  (third floor) , so I have to live  „locked in a cage”.  I never go
  outside  only when I have to go to doctors. There is no lift in here.
  I am generally not able to draw, paint, sing (because of the asthma),
  taking photos or do anything else like I used to do. I have had many
   combined antibiotics cure oral (8) and intravenous(1) too, and have
  also tried natural medicines, but my condition has not improved yet.
   I am not self-sufficient , so my mother has to take care of me. My
  life is filled with pain and sadness. I am very lonesome and have no
  chance to found a family or start a career. I often  cry because I
  don’t want to live this way anymore.  My mother spent her whole salary
  for the medicines and doctors. My father died in cancer in 2011. It’s hard for me to say but we need donations to pay the expensive
  medicines and dietary supplements. We also would like to try some kind
  of health therapies. It’ s impossible for me to travel abroad to get a
  specific health treatment because of financial reasons, but I need it. Please, help me to get A chance  for a better, healthier life!  We
  trust the good people. Every little amount of money counts. Thank you
  very-very much gratefully  for your help in advance!! Update  30, March, 2016 Dear my Visitors, Unfortunately, we still need help!! The only
  ""medication"" for my neuropathic pain is the Serra peptase
  enzyme which costs 93.99 dollar / bottle . I must take 8 caps/day.
  This can reduce my pain a little. And I also need other dietary
  supplements and medications too ( sleeping pill, antiallergic meds etc.). Please, share my story with your friends, if you have a little time!
  Thank you. ---------------- Segítse Juditot a súlyos krónikus Lyme-kór elleni küzdelmében! Üdvözlöm az oldalamon! A segítségét szeretném kérni. 29 éves nő vagyok, Magyarországon élek.
  9 éve szenvedek súlyos krónikus lyme- betegségtől  (kései stádium) és
  az ún. társfertőzésektől ( babézia, bartonella, mycoplazma fermentans
  - a kullancs a Lyme-kórral gyakran egyéb súlyos betegségeket is bevisz
  a szervezetbe, mint pl.  a Mycoplazma Fermentanst) . A különböző, évek
  óta folyamatosan fennálló fájdalmak mostanra már nagyon megviseltek. 5-6 éves lehettem, amikor néhány kullancs megcsípett. Akkor még nem
  derült fény a betegségemre. 19 éves koromban hirtelen erős, tartósan
  megmaradó kéz -és karfájdalmaim lettek mindkét oldalamon, amelyet
  további tünetek követtek később: merev nyak és gerinc, isiász,
  szemfájdalom és fényérzékenység, fülfájás és hangérzékenység, súlyos
  emésztőrendszeri problémák, mint a gyomorfekély, savas reflux – GERD,
  krónikus IBS (bélgyulladás), krónikus fáradtság szindróma, depresszió
  , remegés, rángás, inszomnia (krónikus alvászavar), asztma, arthritis,
  fejfájás, szisztémás candida. Ezek mind Lyme-tüntek, de az orvosok nem
  ismerték fel. Nem tudták, mit kezdjenek velem, mert a leleteim mind
  negatívok voltak. Szteroidot adtak annak ellenére, hogy az autoimmun
  panelom is negatív volt. Csak 2010-ben kaptam hivatalos krónikus
  Lyme-kór-diagnózist, amikor a Western Blot-tesztem pozitív lett.
  Sajnos ekkor már túl késő volt. A Lyme-kór  ú.n. harmadik stádiumában
  vagyok, ami a legutolsó, legsúlyosabb fázis. 2014 októberében pozitív
  lett a kryptopyrrol (KPU/HPU) tesztem is.  Ezt is kezelni kellene. 7
  éve nem tudok normálisan járni sem, csak a lakásban pár lépést. 9 éve
  pedig nem tudom normálisan használni a kezemet az erős  neuropáthiás
  (ideggyulladás) fájdalomtól. Nem tudok felemelni egy poharat sem
  fájdalom nélkül. A nyakam is fáj és nagyon fáradékony. Nagyon
  rövidlátó vagyok, de a szemüvegemet nem tudom hordani az erős
  szemfájdalmam miatt. Nem tudok lemenni a panellakásom lépcsőin
  (harmadik emelet), ezért  „ketrecbe zárva  ” kell élnem. Soha nem
  megyek ki az utcára, csak, ha orvoshoz kell mennem. Nálunk nincs lift. Általában nem tudok rajzolni, festeni, fényképezni, énekelni (az
  asztma miatt) , sem mással foglalkozni, amivel azelőtt szoktam.
  Rengeteg orális (8) és intravénás (1) kombinált antibiotikum-kúrám
  volt, alternatív (természetes) terápia is, ám egyiket sem követte
  javulás. Nem tudom ellátni magam, így édesanyám segít nekem ebben. Az
  életem fájdalommal és szomorúsággal teli. Nagyon magányos vagyok és 
  esélyem sincs arra, hogy családot alapítsak, vagy akár munkát
  találjak. Gyakran sírok, mert nem akarok továbbra is így élni.
  Édesanyám egész fizetése elmegy a gyógyszerekre és az orvosokra .
  Édesapám 2011-ben elhunyt rákban. Nehéz kimondani, de szükségünk lenne adományokra, hogy fizetni tudjuk
  a drága gyógyszereket és a táplálékkiegészítőket. Szeretnénk
  megpróbálni más terápiákat. Jó lenne külföldi lehetőségekre is
  gondolni, de ez egyelőre elérhetetlen számunkra pénzügyi okok miatt. Kérem, segítsen, hogy esélyt kapjak egy jobb, egészségesebb életre!
  Bízunk a jó emberekben. Minden kis összeg számít. Előre is
  nagyon-nagyon hálásan megköszönöm a segítségét!! Frissítés - 2016. márc. 30 Sajnos, még mindig segítségre van szükségünk!! Az egyedüli
  ""gyógyszer"" a neuropátiás fájdalmaimra a Serra peptáz enzim,
  melyből egy doboz 26 000 Ft -ba kerül. Napi 8 db.-ot kell szednem,
  hogy kicsit tudjam használni a két kezem és lábam (ebben sajnos nincs
  benne, hogy tudnék rendesen járni). És emellett más
  étrend-kiegészítőkre és gyógyszerekre is szükségem van (mint pl.
  altatóra, antiallergikumra) Kérem, ossza meg néha a történetemet barátaival, ha van egy kis
  ideje! Köszönöm.",370,,https://fundrazr.com/312za0,Help Judit to fight against Chronic Lyme Disease!,,,

"This is beautiful Tamseel. He is 10 years old now and currently
    studying in Grade 6. From the day Tamseel was born there was just something so
      special about him. A decent boy inside and out and mature beyond
      his years, a child who always had a smile on his face and loved
      being the apple of his parents eyes. Soon after his birth, he had to face the complications of this
    world; he had to put effort in something, we never feel doing –
    breathing & digesting. Yes, he had to put effort in breathing
    and digesting food as well. His lungs and pancreas were not normal.
    But he could not tell anyone, he could not express it. Consequently,
    he fell sick and was taken to hospital. But the disease was not
    common and couldn’t be diagnosed. Time continued ticking and he was still not diagnosed. Most of
    his life spent in hospital until he reached the age of 3 when
    doctors finally suggested to refer him for advanced treatment. Dr. Jay Panikar and Dr. Nezar Kherala started treatment and soon
    diagnosed him a patient of cystic fibrosis, a life threatening disease. The medication of cystic fibrosis is quite expensive and the
    patients have to spend a lot of time out of their daily routine on
    nebulization, physiotherapies and other exercises. At the same time,
    they have to take special meals and lots of medicines on daily basis. It was time to begin Tamseel’s brave and courageous battle.
    Tamseel now in the prime of his life is dealing with more than any
    human should. In the last 7 years he had countless radiation and
    chemo treatments. Yet he’s still smiling and trying to live as a
    normal child should. Praying for a miracle every day we live in hope that our prayers
    are finally being answered and he’ll be able to eat an ice
  cream one day. But this journey is long. Doctors at Cleveland clinic have informed us that continued
    treatments are the best we can do to keep Tamseel comfortable. He needs medical help with all his breaths and whenever he eats. With all of these efforts comes a financial burden that no
    family should have to worry about while desperately trying to save
    the life of their child . All donations are

"It has almost been a year since my wife and I have decided to live in
  Benin, West Africa all the way from South Korea. My wife is a
  specilist doctor in emergency medicine and I am a missionary. Here we
  belong to an organization called Service Medical Volunteer(SMV) the
  words for the organization are bit upsidedown since here is a french
  speaking country and we run a hospital. Benin is a poor country where GDP per capita sits at 202nd ,according
  to CIA factbook, which I guess is one of the poorest country in the
  whole world. There is no Mc Donald, KFC, Starbucks, BurgerKing and so
  many other things. But people do eat something and trying to make living. One day, a certain patient came and he was bleeding at a motorcycle
  accident but our hospital doesn't have x-ray machine nor CT scan to
  check which part of his body has been fractured or ruptured so we
  could not provide him the right medical service even though we had
  three doctors next to him. So, we began to serch for a place where we could have medical
  equipments donated and thanks to God we found a NGO called MedShare in
  Atlanta, Georgia. They collect surplus or replacing medical equipments
  in the states and send them in a container for countries like Benin. So, People! Please gather your hands for Benin. I know that the name

"Hi, I’m Karen Lewellen. Growing up legally blind, the doctors told me there was nothing they
  could do for me. I struggled, but was determined not to let any
  obstacle stop me from showing brilliance and creativity. The list of things people told me I couldn’t do was a long one – but
  I could sing, and I started rewriting the melodies of misery with
  music. My voice did what nothing else could do for me: challenge the
  stereotypes others held of me, and help me connect and bond with people. The Problem Then, in 1992, during an eye surgery I was given too much
  anaesthetic, which caused a slight stroke. I started having trouble
  understanding speech, and difficulties speaking clearly myself. I could not properly talk to people, let alone make music. My vision worsened due to unexplained scar tissue. A 2003
    diagnosis from NYU Medical Center showed that the effects of the
    damage to my brain worsen with stress. Factor in a rape, a bout of
    homelessness, and the death of my father – one of the few people to
    love me unconditionally -- and you may understand how stressful my
    life became. My conditioned worsened. The Solution New medical advances are giving me hope that I will see and hear
    again. The science is called Neural Plasticity, and you can read
    more about the success stories here: www.normandoidge.com David Suzuki’s show on CBC, The Nature of Things, did an episode
    on this ground-breaking work. You can watch it here: www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/the-brains-way-of-healing How it Works This medical treatment that will heal my eyes uses laser light
    to train the brain that it doesn’t need to produce scar tissue
    behind my eyes, which impairs my vision. Dr. David Weber, who I hope to work with, cured his legal

"As someone who enjoys a challenge and also likes making things
    10 times more complicated than they need to be, well, let's just say
    there was no passing this one up.  When I was asked by a group of
    friends if I was up for a 3-day backpacking trip in the middle of
    nowhere PA, I was in.  Andrea (my wife) didn't think it was the best
    of ideas for me because as many of you know, I’ve had hip related
    issues my entire life.  These issues stem from Legg-Calve-Perthes
    Disease, ( http://www.tsrhc.org/Perthes-Disease ) which I
    was diagnosed with as a 7 years old.  Now, 30 years later, I have
    had my third operation and am probably not far off from my fourth to
    completely replace my hip. My twist on the hike, (partially so Andrea couldn't say no,
    but mostly to help an organization that has done so much for me) was
    to turn the trip into a fundraising event.  The Texas Scottish Rite
    Hospital for Children ( http://www.tsrhc.org/ ) was
    instrumental in providing treatment, consulting to local doctors in
    Cleveland, and enormous financial support to cover surgery that was
    at on time considered experimental and not covered by insurance.
     Not only did they pay for two surgeries when I was 8 and 9, but
    they also continue to follow my progress.  They recently flew me
    down to Dallas to meet with Dr. Kim to continue to search for the
    best possible long term outcomes they can find for other children
    effected by this and similar diseases.  They treat all children,
    regardless of financial ability to pay for their care.  The staff
    and building are simply amazing.  The building is warm and inviting
    and filled with volunteers who greet the children comfortable. For our trip, we will be leaving March 24th, late in the
    afternoon.  We will be hiking the full 36 + miles of the Gerard
    Hiking Trail ( http://friendsocsp.org/trails/hiking/ght.html )
    in Oil City PA.  The first day will consist of an evening hike of
    about 7.5 miles.  We will be staying at the Woltkiel Run Trail
    Shelter Area.  Day 2 will consist of roughly 15 miles of hiking,
    followed by staying at the Cow Run Trail Shelter Area.  Sunday
    morning, we will wake and complete the final 15.5 miles before
    heading home. I greatly appreciate all your support.  I would love to raise
    $5,000 on this trip for the Texas Scottish Rite Hosptial for
    Children.  Please donate and share the link to this event with as
    many friends and family as possible. For more information on Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease please see

"I've recorded three albums, been commissioned to compose original
  music for vloggers, product launches and weddings and I've been a demo
  vocalist, but I didn't join the musicians union or get paid scale
  wages until I dated an abusive controlling sound engineer in LA.  The
  only union scale money I made or industry gigs I got were through him.
  I sang for producers like Matthew Gerrard who wrote songs for Kelly
  Clarkson, and companies like Disney and Nickelodeon.  Leaving him was
  hard, and it's painful to listen to the most impressive parts of my
  resume because those jobs are linked to my abuse and disappeared when
  I fled.  It's tough to miss days full of real industry gigs that
  validated me as a working musician but that included domestic rape
  that night. He was good at subtly making sure I didn't have my own set
  up to strengthen my dependence on him.  Now I don't have the gear to
  record my voice and when people ask me to sing on a project I have to
  pass. I spent the last three years processing what happened me, naming it,
  building back up my credit after it was trashed from unpaid hospital
  bills trying to get financially reimbursed by domestic violence victim

  sent home on hospice twice, 18 surgeries, 5 different chemotherapies

"[ NOTE: This fundraiser replaces the fundraiser
      I began on YouCaring.com. YouCaring deleted my fundraiser, which
      is disappointing. The good news is that I had already withdrawn
      the donations collected up through 01/10/17 ( screenshot here ), so I am already $215
      closer to my goal of $625!] I found out on Wednesday (01/04/17) that I'm pregnant, and I
    want to terminate the pregnancy. I'm trying to raise funds to help
    me pay for a surgical abortion. My appointment is on 01/20/17, which
    is past the time that I can obtain a less costly medical abortion. The Texas Equal Access Fund will be assisting with travel and
      lodging, so I am only trying to cover the cost of the procedure
      itself and the cost for a dogsitter. (My husband is driving me to
      the clinic, leaving no one to care for our dog while we're away.
      For obvious reasons, we'd prefer to not bring him with us and
      might not even be able to depending on what lodging TEA Fund can
      help provide.) My husband and I recently took a large financial blow and
      while we could cover this cost by using the remaining credit on
      our emergency credit card, it would place us into a very
      precarious financial situation. We would not be able to shoulder
      any additional surprise expenses - car trouble, a medical
      emergency, etc. and that is a scary place to exist. The costs I am trying to cover with this fundraiser are as follows: Procedure: $575 (quoted by the closest PP location, about 300
      miles away) Pet sitter: $50 ($25/night for 2 nights) SUBTOTAL: $625 I was able to withdraw the $215 I had already collected through
    YouCaring ($225 in donations, minus about $10 service fee from
    YouCaring), so I'm really only looking at raising another $410. I am
    asking for $450 because FundRazr will charge me 5-7% of the funds
    collected, plus another 2.9% + 30 cents of each transcation
    (donation). My math is as follows: 410 * 1.099 = 450.59. I want
      to make sure that the funds I collect will actually cover my
      expenses, which is why I'm also trying to cover the ~$40 that will
      be charged to use the Fundrazr platform. TOTAL GOAL: $450 I will provide receipts after the procedure to show that any
      donated funds are used only for the purposes listed above. If the
      funds raised exceed my target goal of $450 then any/all
        excess funds will be donated directly to the Texas Equal Access
        Fund to assist someone else with their need for abortion care. If you have any questions please feel free to ask by leaving a

"***UPDATE*** MY DREAMS AND SURGERIES TO TRANSITION DIDNT GO TO FULL PLAN. Although
  I set up this fundraiser years ago, I paid for all of my surgeries myself.. My goal was to raise $10,000. My surgeries and treatments were over
  $60 000 and will be on going. As you can see, I have a  permanent hole with continuous
  seeping/weepingoozing/dripping mucus after a suture surfaced from the
  tip of my nose. Other complications and onggoing sinus/nasla
  infections. Yes check the pictures.. I have other reconstructive
  issues also unmentioned. I guess the worst part of this problem is
  living a recluse lifestyle. I feel like a begger but what is the worst
  that can happen. Some will help or donate, some will laugh and mock or
  some will say no. So as they say if you dont try you will never know.
  Regardless of the goal I still will proceed on my journey. Every bit
  helps, even one dollar. IF YOU CAN JOIN IN AND HELP ME FIX MY beautifully botched self that
  would be beyond appreciated. XOXOX Thank you xx 4YEARS AGO:EVERYONE HAS A DREAM, PLEASE HELP AND SUPPORT ME WITH
  MINE. When I was a litttle boy, all I ever wanted to be when I grew up
  was a GIRL. A Transsexual Woman. PLEASE HELP me continue on my journey
  of my transition and make all my dreams come true. Lets see this once
  beautiful baby boy transform into a BEAUTIFUL TRANSSEXUAL WOMAN. In
  2002 I was diagnosed with a condition called Gender Identity Disorder.
  Gender Identity Disorder (AKA: Transsexualism) is a medical condition
  where the gender of the body and the gender of the brain don’t match.
  The only treatment for this is correcting the body’s gender to match
  the brains with surgeries. These surgeries are not covered by most insurance/healthcare
  providers and are very expensive and need a specialized surgeon to
  perform them. In this world of complicated procedures and advanced
  healthcare you would think that something as simple as treating
  someone with a birth defect would be not that complicated, but in my
  case it’s not. Even though GID is a recognized and treated condition
  most insurance/healthcare companies and doctors refuse to cover the
  cost of this costly lifelong condition that if not treated will cause
  severe depression and even death by suicide. I need these
  surgeries to have a normal and fulfilling life. I was born with a
  female brain and a male body and I cannot correct my brain so I’m left
  with no option but to correct my body. This affects every aspect of my
  life and causes me great suffering because I’m not able to complete my
  treatment. I really hope that I can find the help I need. PLEASE

"Hello everyone, my friend Elizabeth tragically lost her depression
  therapy dog DynKus and is understandably devastated. Her story is
  below. If you can donate any money to help her purchase another fur
  baby we would really appreciate it. She’ll also need a new puppy
  crate, puppy food, toys, etc. You know, everything a new healthy puppy needs! “My depression has been with me all my life. I grew up in the
  generation that believed in kids were not to be seen or heard. I was
  not allowed to have feelings about anything. If I did, I was told I
  was feeling sorry for myself. If I was victimized it was my fault. I
  was a fifties kid. My Counselor I had in the early 90's suggested that
  I get a companion dog. The point as I understand it is to get me to
  think less about inward issues and ruminating myself into more
  anxiety. So off I went to find my English Springer Spaniel puppy. I
  looked all over Kansas and wouldn't you know it, there was a breeder
  about 30 miles away. Ivey was a Liver and White puppy and so
  beautiful. Everyone always had wonderful remarks about how cute she
  was, so you see having Ivey gave me more opportunity to talk to
  others. Having a pet opens doors to start conversations and maybe even
  friendships. One thing I did learn was to use my ""Mommy""
  voice. I believe I gained the understanding of being responsible you
  have to be controlling and caring as to not to endanger Ivey to
  harmful situations. A more clear communication of ""No means
  No"" stance. Ivey was a great dog. She was very smart, loving, and
  the best part she was there. She always slept with me. What are the
  words to describe the feelings you experience at the end of the day
  when you have the warmth of your companion’s body curled beside your
  back? I have many, many wonderful stories of our life together. She
  had a good life. We were together for over 15 years. After Ivey had to be put down, I swear I could still feel her close
  to me for about a year or so. Then the Universe/God blessed me with my
  little Dynkus. I had been stopping at the Banner Creek Vet in Holton
  Kansas every time I went to go visit my family. I would pop in and
  ask,""do you have a dog for me yet?"" Then one day they called
  me and they did have an 8 week old puppy for me. He was this blonde
  bundle of fur, all wiggles and smiles. For me it was love at first
  sight. Such a blessing. You see when you have a Havanese you have
  endless smiles, happiness and great goofiness all rolled into one
  package. I loved every round inch of that puppy. My day would start
  with giggles and kisses. I was always amazed at what he could do. With
  DynKus I lived in the moment. Here was this little dog just begging to
  be loved. And let me tell you saying I love you did not come easy for
  me. But with DynKus it came easier every day. To be able to say I love
  you and not be afraid, to say I love you and mean it is priceless. He
  was goofy, lord knows I never knew what he would get hold of and drag
  it down the hallway. He was a climber too. Life for me was being lived
  in the moment. Being in that state of mind kicked depression right out
  of my life. I watched him scamper on our walks, and smell everything,
  so much joy. He was a flirt, he was a dancing doggie and when we got
  close to an apartment that he knew he would go and get on his two back
  paws and just hop and dance across the parking lot. There is so much
  more to share, he made waking up a joy and full of giggles. He would
  run very fast thru the apt just for his own pleasure. Even the quiet
  times had pleasure in the fact that most time you could not tell his
  top from his bottom. But one of the best parts was the fact that he
  needed me! Not to feed him or give him treats, but to just cuddle, or
  comfort him when he was scared of the storm. I think maybe I learned
  how to nurture him and myself and it didn't hurt. I was not as bad, I
  could love and be loved. I need and want another DynKus in my life to
  survive the best way that I know how with the love of a crazy little dog.”",110,,https://fundrazr.com/9rk4b,Help Elizabeth with costs for a new therapy puppy!,,,
"Hello! My name is Shona Brown. I'm a certified Compassion Fatigue
  Specialist, an ordained Anglican priest and former victim service
  worker. I've experienced both burn-out and compassion fatigue
  first-hand. I know what it feels like to be tired of being sick and
  tired. And I know how overwhelming it can be to recover. The World Health Organisation has declared that burn-out is the
  health epidemic of the 21st century. ‘Do More with Less’ has
  become the new mantra for many organisations. As a result, burn-out
  and compassion fatigue is impacting thousands of frontline
  professionals such as social service workers, doctors, child
  protection workers, police, nurses, emergency responders, military
  personnel, clergy and chaplains. I've taken this to heart and by June 2017, I'll be launching Black
  Dog Retreats, a full-service retreat business located on the beautiful
  South Shore of Nova Scotia. My business will cater to front-line
  professionals and spiritual care workers who are suffering from
  burn-out or compassion fatigue. I've developed a signature programme
  to enable recovery: Repair Restore Recover©. This programme will be
  the foundation of my retreats and one-on-one work. Group retreats will
  be offered in various locations throughout Nova Scotia, Ontario and Scotland. But my main dream is to offer customized, individual retreats in a
  rustic but luxurious custom-built cabin on my property in Nova Scotia.
  Nestled in almost three acres with organic gardens, free-range hens,
  and miniature goats, Pine Cone Cabin will be the place for rest,
  recovery, and rejuvenation. It will be a four-season cabin, fully
  insulated and with a wood-burning stove for heat. The cabin will be a
  cosy 120 square feet, having space for a double bed, table and chair,
  small kitchen and bathroom with shower and toilet. It will be
  ecologically sustainable, using as many local materials as possible. Retreat packages will include three to five nights of accommodation,
  breakfast each day, individual sessions of Repair Restore Recover© and
  full use of the property. I'm collaborating with local businesses so
  there will be optional add-ons such as massage therapy, acupuncture,
  yoga or art therapy. Pine Cone Cabin will also be available for single
  overnight stays. To reach this goal, I have to raise £8,000 (approximately $13,000 CAD). I'm reaching out to you because I believe we share the same
  goals: compassion, integrity and dedicated, hard work. Would you like
  to take part in helping transform the lives of front-line
  professionals? If so, please consider a donation. Any amount will help! Thank you so much for taking the time to stop by. Please contact me

  fígado. Procuramos outras opções de tratamento, pois a Samantha está
  na última tentativa na medicina convencional. Além disso , a Samantha faz imunoterapia, que
  é bastante dispendiosa, e por isso é necessária ajuda. Após muita pesquisa concluímos que depois deste tratamento, se a
  Samantha não recuperar a saúde , terá que fazer o tratamento das
  células dendríticas na Alemanha. Ele custa cerca de
  28.000 euros, mas há mais despesas que surgirão depois, e cuidados que
  terá que têr, por isso fixamos esta campanha em 40 000 euros. A
  Samanthinha já formalizou o pedido da fosfoetanolamina no Brasil. Por
  favor partilhem e se puderem doar para ajudar nesta luta, fico muito
  grato. Obrigado. MENSAGEM DA SAMANTHA PARA TODOS VOCÊS: Eu te amo, leitor(a) da minha vida e amig o(a).
  Obrigada por existirem e me presentearem com mais um porquê
  de estar viva. Agradeço a minha vida e minhas palavras, espero que
  elas não só acalmem corações, como deem mais alegrias. Essa é minha
  missão. Obrigada. English speakers: This girl is Samantha, an excellent singer who works with me. She had
  a cancer that generated a metastasis in her liver. She has been
  submitted to a chemotherapy but so far it was not enough to eliminate
  the disease, so she now needs donations to obtain alternative therapies. Our dear Samantha is a mother, woman, daughter, wife and a fantastic
  singer. She also studies natural therapies, she's a student of life
  and positivism, and a graduated iridologist; above all, a survivor who
  won four times a secondary cervical cancer. What is intended now is to
  treat that metastasis in her liver. We are looking for other options because Samantha is facing her last
  attempt with conventional medicine, and the treatment by immunotherapy
  is really expensive, which is the reason for asking your help. After a lot of research, we realized that, if this last attempt fail
  to recover Samantha’s health, she‘ll need to move to dendritic cells
  therapy in Germany, which costs about € 28,000. As there are
  additional expenses and special care, we established the value of €
  40,000 for this campaign. Samantha has already applied to receive
  Brazilian fosfoetanolamina but the process will surely be too slow, so
  please share this message and, if you can, make a donation to help us
  in this effort. We’ll be immensely thankful. SAMANTHA’S MESSAGE FOR YOU ALL: Love you, my life’s readers and friends. Thank you for being there
  and giving me this gift and one more reason to stay alive. I thank you
  for my life and for being able to send you these words – I hope they
  not only calm down your hearts but also give you a lot of contentment.

"OUR SWEET AND MOST PRECIOUS FIVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER
  ROSALINA was diagnosed last month with aggressive, high risk,
  stage IV neuroblastoma, the second most common pediatric cancer after leukemia. Testing was done and has showed that there is a massive primary
  tumour in her abdomen, which is pushing up on her pancreas, liver and
  some blood vessels, and which has spread to some of her lymph nodes,
  causing two other tumours. One is in the nodes behind her heart
  between the lungs, which we are told is inoperable, and one in her
  left clavicle. There are also ""innumerable"" smaller sites
  detected in her abdominal area. The cancerous cells have also been
  found in her bone marrow and in the bones in her thighs, upper arms
  and mid-spinal regions. We are completely devastated and life has ceased to be the
  same as it was before her diagnosis. Everything except Rosalina and
  her baby sibling, to be born any day now, has ceased to be of priority. We have been practically living at the Children's Hospital of Eastern
  Ontario since the diagnosis, and Rosalina has already received two
  cycles of chemotherapy. Her conventional treatment plan is to last a
  year and a half, and is just as aggressive as her cancer. We hope to
  counteract some of its very scary side effects with complementary
  therapies and boost her immune system as much as we can so that she
  has all that she needs to get well and stay well. WE CAN'T LET GO OF THE HOPE AND EFFORTS TO HEAL OUR SWEET ROSALINA! We will apply any feasible treatments and complementary therapies
  that we can- this is why we are raising funds for her. These
  treatments include buying Rosalina all organic foods all of the time,
  purchasing supplements of vitamins and minerals and paying for
  naturopathic therapies such as acupuncture sessions. We are also
  raising funds to help pay for travel costs. Our family sincerely thanks you for your contributions. They will all
  add up to making life easier to manage and help to HEAL OUR

    fear”, says the doctor as he sits nervously in a room off intensive
    care at the JM de Los Rios Children’s Hospital in Caracas. Dr Huniades Urbina is trying to expose the desperate shortage of
    drugs and medical supplies in what should be the best equipped
    paediatric unit in Venezuela, but he is taking a great risk. Huge numbers of medicines are now hard or impossible to find,
    from antibiotics and painkillers to anti-epilepsy and chemotherapy drugs. D r Urbina says the unit has gone back to methods and medications
    used decades ago, because of the shortages. Where once they had
    state of the art chemotherapy for cancer patients he says they now
    have to make do with lesser options. “Sometimes people die because
    of these shortages, even here in the best children’s intensive care
    unit in Venezuela”, he says Testing kits for blood and other disposables are also scarce.
    The hospital has taken to boiling and reusing items that are
    supposed to be for single-use. When challenged on the dangers of

"I am needing to raise $26552 for my little boy to get assistant dog
  for autism. Which I sure a t of you will be saying wow that I a lot of
  money just for a dog and u know what you are right but if you take the
  time to read this you might be a bit of a idea of how much this dog
  can do to improve my little boys life everyday and also our family Now
  this is going to be a bit of a long story but please read it trough so
  you can understand how much this means to me, my son and our family. I
  am going to start with the benefits the dog will provide and then I
  will tell you what your puppy (due to be born any day now) will be
  trained in and then I am going to tell you about Ryan and try and give
  you an incite to what our life is like. Not only that we are in a
  special place because our puppy is only just about to be born I will
  be sharing the story with you all from the very start so you will get
  to hear about all the training that goes into an assistance dog, you
  will get to watch the bonding sessions with our puppy and Ryan all the
  way till the day he or she comes home. An assistance dog is trained
  for the needs of each person and just like a guide dog will go
  everywhere with us, they even wear one of those cute little blue
  jackets. First and foremost, they are considered “service” dogs. the
  mission of these animals is to increase the safety of the person with
  autism. For example, such a dog may lower the likelihood of the person
  bolting or crossing a busy street, because it is physically connected
  to the person with autism. The dogs are trained to follow commands
  from parents, stop at doorways, and resist the child moving away by
  using its weight to slow or stop the child The dogs provide a constant
  partner and companion that the child can bond with. In most cases, the
  dog sleeps with the child, allowing for less panic attacks from the
  child and resulting in a more restful nights’ sleep. When working in
  public, most children are tethered to the dog, acting as an anchor for
  a child who may bolt or run away when over-stimulated. The dogs are
  trained to become a canine version of a weighted sensory blanket to
  help the child when the inevitable meltdown occurs. Some nonverbal
  clients have started to speak to the dog or tell others about their
  dog. They also help the child with social activities There are many
  benefits - these are just a few. Each Custom Canine is specifically
  trained to enhance the unique needs of the child and household in
  which they are placed. Some of the things our puppy will be trained
  with are listed below, the other thing you need to understand after
  our puppy comes home his or her training wont stop as Ryan gets older
  his needs will change and so the dog will be trained in those areas to
  help assist Ryan. Targeted skill – Responding to meltdown Targeted
  Skill – Deep Pressure Therapy Targeted Skill – distracting games and
  rough play Targeted Skills – block and cover, for road crossings and
  approach of people in public places Targeted Skill – Alert to leaving
  an area alone Targeted Skill – locating individual, tracking Targeted
  Skills – attending therapies and hospital/Dr. visits So, those are
  just some of the things our puppy will be trained in. And now the most
  important part an incite to Ryan and a bit about my little man. A lot
  of you will look at my little man Ryan and say wow really, he looks
  like any other little boy. And he does look like any other little boy,
  you see like most things we all have in our minds how something should
  look or how it is and I am sure a lot of you when you think of Autism
  (ASD) you think of a child that doesn’t walk or talk and sits in a
  corner rock or flapping their arms and this is the case for some
  children with ASD or on the spectrum. But like most things there are
  different variants and everyone will sit on the spectrum at a
  different level. For children on the spectrum they all share social
  and communication delays as well as restricted and repetitive
  interests the severity of these problems and the impact on a person
  life can very considerably. Some children will avoid eye contact while
  others will smile and hug. Some will have learning difficulties,
  others will top their class. Some will never speak, where others will
  display impressive vocabularies, some will flap their hands and rock
  other will blend without any sign of their condition. What all these
  children do have in common however is a different way of thinking- a
  way of thinking which can make the everyday task of socializing and
  communication very very difficult. Now for Ryan he is classed as high
  function he can walk and talk but his fine motor skills are behind
  more like that of a 3 year not a 6-year-old, give him math’s or
  building and he’s is a wiz but can’t read or write. He doesn’t
  understand social situations and has no empathy at all and his sensory
  are all over the place. For example, if Ryan gets the smallest of cuts
  or bumps it is the end of the world but he will haply jump of the side
  of our water slide like its nothing, to give u an idea of height I am
  5.4 and its taller then me. Another thing with Ryan is he hates change
  or anything new and doesn’t cope so when he need to start school this
  year it was not a lot of fun for me, we get to the school and out of
  the car and Ryan and I played cat and mouse for about 10 minutes
  before I could grab him by this stage I was in tears begging him to
  please just come and see what school was like and the hardest part for
  me wasn’t the cat and mouse game it was when I stood there crying
  begging him to help me he looked straight through me like I wasn’t
  there. He couldn’t understand why I was so upset. On his second day of
  school he had a meltdown one of the biggest he has ever had, when I
  got to the school everyone was out side and his teacher came up to me
  and said “Bec he is ok but we have had to restrain him so he didn’t
  hurt himself” I was like oh no what has he done. I walked into his
  classroom and the easiest way to tell you is it looked like the class
  room had been ransacked, tables and chairs turned upside down, books
  all over the floor and here is Ryan sitting on the floor with his
  principle and she had her arms wrapped around him (not hard or in a
  bad way) to stop him. I took one look at him and then the room and
  bust into tears. Ryan looked at me and said “mummy why is you crying”
  I wanted to scream are u Fxxxing kidding me. It was only days later
  when I was talking to his teacher and she said when Ryan asked me why
  I was crying the look on his face she said he had no idea and don’t
  understand what he had done and why it would upset me. You Ryan is
  such a sweet little boy but life isn’t easy for Ryan what he’s see and
  hears is so different to us, there are days where he will say nothing
  to me but poo poo head or when he’s is playing cars they all must be
  lined up in a row before you can play. Ask him about dinosaurs and he
  can tell you things that you would be like where did you learn that or
  how did he know that. But playing with friends is hard well he doesn’t
  really have any as he doesn’t know when something is game or when
  people have had enough as he can’t read our face like most people do
  to know if your angry or sad. It all about Ryan a lot say tunnel
  vision he only sees his way and that is that. Then there is going to
  the shops with Ryan or out in general with Ryan is just hell on wheels
  and I try and not go out with him, for most of you that saw us at the
  supermarket you would think he was just a naughty little boy that I
  couldn’t control. He normally runs away or runs up and down all the
  isle saying things like poo poo head or he runs away or he hides but
  you see for him its to much going on and this sends his brain and
  sensory into overload and all the noise, colour and people keep
  rushing and he doesn’t know how to process this. For you to understand
  what this may be like I want you to close your eyes and remember the
  first time you walk into a night club the people the loud music all
  the lights glass breaking and it takes you a few minutes to adjust and
  your all good and go have a drink or a dance well for Ryan that first
  few minutes doesn’t stop it keeps going getting worse and worse the
  longer he is there and he doesn’t know how to regulate it and turn it
  off. These are just some of the things that Ryan struggles with in
  everyday life, I could go on to tell you about feeding him and all I
  will say is he eats very little and it must be white except for Icey
  poles give him a white one of those and he will look at you like your
  silly. Now Ryan also has 2 sisters Emma 7 and Grace 2 and they go
  through a lot with him, he hits them and sometimes with his oldest
  Emma she wants some here time and he just doesn’t understand give her
  some space and just keeps asking her to play. So, this assistance dog
  will not only help Ryan with his safety (and yes, he has run out onto
  the road in main traffic) social skills and help with his meltdowns
  but help us as a family. We could go out as a family and know Ryan is
  safe and if he has a meltdown an extra pair of paws I guess would be
  the right words. So please help me raise funds for Ryan and help with
  awareness for autism and assistance dogs. Any help big or small would
  be so much help and mean more then you will ever know. Please share my
  page to anyone you think can help and keep your eye on this page as I
  will add my blog and Facebook page as soon as I have set it all up so
  you can watch our magical story come to life.","5,000",of $26.6k goal,https://fundrazr.com/41ECW3,1 Dog 1 Boy 1 Mircale watch the magical journey,1,"Oct 10, 2018",Australian Dollar
"Jhunnel Sarajan, a property investment consultant and an accidental
  photographer took the powerful photo of Ryan Arebuabo while he was
  feeding his children with no food for himself (photo above).  Jhunnel
  learned  that Ryan brought his two kids to a fast food chain
  restaurant to celebrate his daughter's forthcoming graduation. Ryan
  chose to forego his meal because he did not have enough money to go
  through the day. This is a depiction of genuine selflessness. Jhunnel
  decided to follow Ryan's daily life and posted on Facebook to witness
  a father's genuine selfless love to his children while struggling to
  survive in the high cost of living in Manila.  The touching story was
  featuared in local TV(ABS-CBN) news in the Philippines. The
    Selfless Father's story Ryan Arebuabo, a single parent filipino, 38 yrs old with 2
    children. His wife left him after he suffered stroke.  Half of his
    body is paralyzed and has difficulty in speaking since he cannot
    afford to undergo recovering treatments due to poverty while
    maintaining family budgets.  In a good day Ryan makes P100 to P200
    pesos (C$2.70 to C$5.40).  A bad day would probably bring the family
    only one meal for the day.  Because of Ryan's health conditions, he
    receives government conditional grants for ""Poorest of the
    Poor"" - Php 1,100.00 (C$30) per month for the children
    nutrition and education.  In spite of his unstable financial
    conditions, he chooses to raise his 2 children single-handedly with
    full education while suffering himself in limited meals and medical
    support.  The following photos captured by Jhunnel follows Ryan's
    daily life as street vendor. They live in a 4 square meter shanty made of used plywood and rusty
  iron sheets in the poor slums of Tondo, Manila. Everyday,
  h e wakes up at 5 in the morning to help his children
  (ages 6 and 8) prepare for school and starts street selling as a
  vendor in a small store cart. I am Bernadette Mallari, a Masters in Business Administration student
  at UNBC in Canada and a fellow Filipino who wants to reach out for
  Ryan and create the ""Selfless Father"" campaign for him
  through Fundrazr.com to raise funds to purchase
   medical leg brace for his mobility. I have coordinated with the Department of Social Welfare (DSW)
  Philippines who conciliate on behalf of Ryan and his family in the
  Philippines.  After the campaign, total amount raised will be remitted
  to Ryan in his bank account.  Social worker from DSW will assist him
  at the bank and document the process.  This event will be posted on
  Ryan's Facebook account (created by Jhunnel) that will show updates of
  progress of his life after receiving the donation.   Social worker
  will attend to these FB updates.  See link below: https://m.facebook.com/theselflessfather/ Please donate whatever amount you can afford to help Ryan Arebuabo

"On Sunday, May 21st, 2017, six members of Team Ride to Give participated in Ironman 70.3 Chattanooga on
    behalf 3-year-old Cezar Maldonado. They were: Kevin Baxter 2166 * Beth Berger 715 Bill Halstead 619 * Morgan Hendricks 540 David Nazaroff 687 * Carol Zrybko 1640 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ And on Saturday, May 21st, Leigh Roberts Duquette participated in the Dina LaVigna Breath of Life
        Ventura Triathlon . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ On July 12th, 2013, David and Rebecca Maldonado of Dayton, TN, along
  with big brother Izaiah, welcomed baby Cezar into their family.  Life
  for the Maldonados was wonderfully full and felt perfect until May of
  2016 when for no apparent reason Cezar began limping.  His first
  hospital stay was on May 19th, 2016 where he had three x-rays, an MRI,
  and fluid removed from his hip, knee, and ankle. Cezar was
  subsequently sent home, and his parents were given no definitive
  answers as to why their sweet toddler was limping. They returned to
  his primary care physician a few weeks later when they were told
  Cezar’s blood work came back abnormal and that his liver and spleen
  were enlarged. Cezar was directly admitted to the hematology/oncology unit at Children’s Hospital at
    Erlanger in Chattanooga where his parents were told their
    3-year-old had pre-b cell Acute Lymphoblastic
      Leukemia (ALL) which has a survival rate of 95%. In a
  child with ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B
  lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are cancer (leukemia)
  cells. The leukemia cells do not work like normal lymphocytes and are
  not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia
  cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for
  healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may
  lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. Cezar received blood and
  platelets and had a port placed so he could begin chemotherapy
  treatments. During the port placement surgery on June 9th, Cezar had
  heart rate complications causing this relatively simple operation to
  take longer than expected. Cezar came out of surgery with a chest tube
  and had to recover in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for two days. Following this surgery, he was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome .
  In Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, an extra electrical pathway
  between the heart's upper and lower chambers causes a rapid heartbeat.
  This additional pathway is present at birth and relatively rare. How
  often a rapid heart rate occurs varies depending on the person. Some
  individuals with WPW syndrome have only a few episodes of rapid heart
  rate. Others may have the rapid heart rate once or twice a week or
  more. Also, there may be no symptoms at all, so like Cezar, WPW is
  found only when a heart test is done for another reason. After his first chest tube was removed, Cezar had complications which
  led to another surgery to remove fluid that had built up around his
  heart and lung. This meant more chest tubes and another PICU stay.
  This second hospital stay lasted nine days, and Cezar received chemo,
  a lumbar puncture, blood and platelets three times, three abdominal
  x-rays, 14 chest x-rays, a lymph node scan, an EKG, and echo and a
  bone marrow aspirate. Cezar’s parents were shocked when the
    results from the bone marrow aspirate changed his diagnosis from
    Pre-B cell ALL to Philadelphia+ Pre-B cell ALL, a form of leukemia
    that only has a 30% survival rate. Their hearts sank with
  fear for their young son but were told that if he uses the medication Gleevec every day it could increase his survival
  rate to 70%. Cezar now takes Gleevec every day, through a feeding tube
  that was placed because he could not take this strong medication by
  mouth without throwing up. One of the complications Cezar has suffered from his time spent
  confined to a hospital bed is the loss of range of motion in his
  ankles. His muscle mass decreased so much so that he could not even
  stand, let alone walk. Cezar started physical therapy and for many
  months had to use braces and a walker to get around. With continued
  physical therapy, Cezar has increased his range of motion and his
  overall strength. Cezar has been in treatment for less than a year and still has a long
  road ahead of him battling ALL. He typically spends around two weeks
  per month in the hospital, which has taken an enormous financial toll
  on his family’s finances. His father, David, is a custodian at the Tennessee Valley Authority in Chattanooga while
  his mother, Rebecca, attends to Cezar’s health issues. It has been a
  rough year, and they are behind on bills and have many out of pocket
  medical expenses. This is where Ride to Give has offered to step in and offer
    the Maldonado family our support.  On Sunday, May 21st, six members
    of Team Ride to Give will participate in Ironman 70.3 Chattanooga on
    behalf of Cezar. They will proudly battle the half-Ironman race
    course while Cezar bravely battles cancer. For updates, please join Cezar's Facebook Group, ""Cezar 's journey"" Contributions are solicited with the

"Meet Tenora We met her when her wounds were still scabs. When this 43-year old
  single mother of 2 told our group her story . . . she wept. We wept
  too. This young woman named Tenora had endured more in one year than
  all of us had in a lifetime. She told us about her two children
  Kameron age 10 and Kaleb age 7. She told us that in 2011 she was
  diagnosed with breast cancer. She told us about the many weeks of
  aggressive chemotherapy treatments and how she had tried so hard to be
  strong for her boys. She told us how overwhelming it had been to do it
  all alone – to manage doctors appointments, handle all the side
  effects, continue the necessity of full-time work, and still be a
  present and loving mother to two children who needed her desperately. It was overwhelming. She recalled to us a time when she remembered not caring if God took
  her life. The disease that had invaded her body was taking a toll on
  her mind and heart. Instead of giving up, Tenora decided her only
  option was to turn her eyes and attention to God. She knew there
  wasn't a way out of her situation without His help and His strength.
  She could not survive this journey on her own. She prayed and He
  answered her prayers by lifting her up and carrying her through the
  pain and dark shadows that cancer so often casts. Slowly she healed. Slowly her hair grew back. With time, she could see her boy’s faces without looking through the
  tears in her eyes. She told us how as painful as the cancer had been
  in her and her family's life, it was all worth it because of what she
  gained as a result of getting up close and personal with God. Tenora praised God for bringing her through the storm and she
      was able to clearly see His mercy to her. Our group was there when Tenora was baptized professing her faith in
  Jesus Christ. We listened and encouraged her when she talked about her
  dream of starting a nonprofit organization called "" Rays of Hope Foundation "" which would help
  single women like her going through cancer. And we were there when she recently told us that the cancer was back. The double mastectomy was scheduled just a few days later. While she
  was still recovering from one surgery she was scheduled for another.
  The doctor informed her that he would implant a port, a small disc
  about the size of a quarter, surgically inserted just under the skin
  between the collarbones. This port would provide an opening to her
  bloodstream for 12 weeks and the poison would run wild and wreck havoc
  on her body and her life. She knew this chemo monster well and it
  isn’t welcome again in her body - in her life. We had no words. So we pray. We pray that the kids don't go to sleep at night worrying about
      whether their mother will be there for them in the morning. We pray that her bills will get paid even thought she can't face
      opening them. We pray that God will carry her as He did before. We pray that she doesn't have to work through treatments. We pray that she can take a day at a time and not worry about tomorrow. We pray that God will show up bigger and better than He did before. We pray that if you are reading this that you will help by
      praying for Tenora and if you are moved to help financially, we
      challenge you to think of one thing you can give up for 12 weeks,
      the length of time Tenora will spend in chemo.  Instead of buying
      that one thing every week, please consider donating the money to
      pay for Tenora's expenses. If everyone who reads this, could give
      up the cost of 12 cups of coffee or 12 meals or 12 gallons of gas
      or even just 12 dollars. Every little (or big) bit helps. We pray that you will be moved to make a difference in Tenora's story. Sincerely, Tenora's Team - a group of women that God put in her life to help her
  along her journey.","24,120",,https://fundrazr.com/b13bp7,Tenora's Team,,,

"In 2012, at 24 years old, I was diagnosed with a fatal and rare liver
  disease called Budd-chiari syndrome. The diagnosis came after many
  months of painful symptoms, extensive blood tests, ultrasounds, CT
  scans, and MRI’s. I had developed cirrhosis of the liver and it was on
  its way to failing. I wanted more information so I started researching online which,
  as it turns out, was a terrible idea. Some things I remember… “3 year
  life expectancy if untreated. If caught early enough can be treated
  with medication. T.I.P.S. procedure to increase life expectancy. Last
  resort is a liver transplant.” A transplant? I think I sobbed that
  entire night in bed. I had no idea what I was dealing with but I knew
  that it was a complete shift in my life forever. I was referred to a doctor at Cedars-Sinai and he eventually
  explained to me what was wrong and sent me to a hematologist (blood
  doctor) to figure out how I had Budd-chiari and the head surgeon on
  the Liver Transplant team. I learned I had 4 different blood disorders that made it so my
  blood clots more than it should. And as the surgeon later explained to
  me, unbeknownst to me, blood had been clotting in my veins going from
  my liver to my heart over a long period of time and it had almost
  completely closed the pathway off so that my blood had no choice but
  to return from where it came and go into smaller veins and to other
  places it shouldn’t, like my oft swollen legs, and into my liver and
  spleen, causing them to enlarge. and take damage I was put on medications to see if they could help. I started
  taking blood thinner injections, pills to reduce my blood pressure and
  even more pills to help reduce swelling and water retention. While
  getting used to the medication I started passing out in the middle of
  the day and it became very difficult to leave the house or do anything
  as I was constantly fatigued. After 2 months, my hematologist told me
  the blood thinners were working enough so that more closing wouldn’t
  occur but it couldn’t do anything for the existing clots. My surgeon
  suggested I get on the list for the transplant and after many grueling
  tests in that were both physically and emotionally tough to deal with,
  I was approved to be put on the list for a liver transplant. It felt like the waiting game had begun, but I tried to keep up
  with pursuing my art and also participated in several events for the
  American Liver Foundation to try and give back. It was a scary time
  but it was also a time to try and help others who were facing similar
  issues to me. On Halloween of 2013, I had the T.I.P.S operation performed on
  me to prevent large varices that had developed in my esophagus from
  bursting and bleeding. The small stent they would place would allow my
  blood to flow better and bring pressures down, but after 5 hours of
  operation, unfortunately, they were unable to place it. I was told I wasn’t a candidate for a surgical shunt and the
  only hope was to apply for more points on the list to get me higher
  and get the transplant quicker. Unfortunately, UNOS, the group in
  charge of organ distribution, rejected the request. After that, I got
  food poisoning, was admitted to the hospital for the first time and
  they ended up tapping my stomach and releasing 4 liters of liquid from
  my belly. I decided, after getting advice from several people who had
  transplants, that I should list in another part of the country with a
  shorter wait time. I chose the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida
  and in January of 2014 I went for 2 weeks to get listed. They were
  probably 2 of the most difficult weeks of my life. I was living in a
  house on site with a bunch of other sick people with cancer, heart
  failure, lung failure and the only time I left was to go to the
  hospital for tests. The big thing that they stressed was that if I
  listed there I would need to move to the area to be active and that I
  also had to have health insurance that they accepted. Considering that I was unable to work all year I was in danger
  of losing my health insurance for the next year, so when I came to LA
  I asked many friends to help me maintain it if they had any jobs they
  could throw my way and many of them did, to which I am eternally grateful. When I returned I also had a special procedure where a doctor
  scoped me to see if I could be a candidate for the shunt surgery
  thought originally impossible and after seeing the results of that my
  surgeon decided he could perform surgery on me. I found myself in the hospital again that June needing another
  stomach tap and then on July 10 I had a meso-caval shunt surgery to
  get my blood to redirect itself around my liver straight to my heart.
  It was mostly successful except I had a lot of water stuck in my body…
  and later other complications would arise. I went to the ER twice over the next 2 weeks until I hit a fever
  of 103 and was readmitted. I was there for 2 weeks and experienced
  some of the most painful days of my life, the details of which I’ll
  spare you, but my doctors decided to radiologically place a stent in a
  major vein that runs through the liver called the IVC. It was still a
  bit blocked and the widening of it allowed everything to flow more
  easily. That surgery ended up being a success and almost overnight I
  lost around 40 lbs of water weight. After that surgery, with disability money running out, I decided
  to start working as hard as I could again which quickly resulted in
  extreme fatigue and a lot of muscle pain. A blood test revealed that I
  was now experiencing iron and potassium deficiencies. I soon started
  getting infusions into the new year and those lasted about 6 months.
  That’s when the source of my iron deficiency was discovered. I had an
  intestinal bleed and they needed to close it up. I went in for the
  procedure twice and it was unsuccessful both times. In the midst of that, I developed a case of hepatic
  encephalopathy over July 4th weekend. This was probably one of the
  scariest things that has ever happened. Basically, because my liver is
  no longer processing my blood and pushing toxins out they had traveled
  to my brain creating major confusion. It became hard to focus, read,
  concentrate, remember things, even know where I was. It was like early
  dementia. I had to go to the hospital and get medication for it and it
  went away for a few days but then came right back shortly after and
  had to be treated again. It had put me in a bad place emotionally and after a week out of
  the hospital, while waiting to go back for another procedure to close
  up my intestinal bleed I kind of lost hope. Even though I had already
  been through so much and gotten through it, when it came to my brain
  and me feeling like I would lose the parts of myself that made me who
  I am, forget who it was I knew and loved and even how to do basic
  things like take care of myself enough to remember to eat or to read,
  I hit a very low point. The other major battle of this disease along with all of the
  physical pain is that emotionally, I’ve had to deal with a lot of
  depression and isolation. I decided to take myself to a hospital for
  mental health because the weight of everything felt like too much.
  That was one of the most humbling experiences of my life. There’s a
  lot of pain in the world and being there gave me a renewed sense of
  purpose. I knew that I needed to get out and keep fighting despite how
  difficult it’s been. I was released from the hospital and was able to go back in for
  surgery and this time the bleed was gone. My iron was looking normal
  again. In August 2015 , I had a hernia surgery. Basically, after last
  year’s procedure, a hernia formed on my incision that started jutting
  out and hurting me and we needed to remove it. It’s also been a daily
  fight to keep my potassium levels normal and my digestion normal, and
  I often end up in the hospital for one or the other, most recently
  being on Thanksgiving. I had to retake a bunch of tests to keep my
  place on the transplant list this month and my next known visit is
  still pending on December 30th for an endoscopy. Needless to say, with the amount of time I’ve spent in the
  hospital I’ve been unable to really work. I take shifts at my very
  flexible job when I can, but it’s just not enough. Especially with all
  of the outstanding medical bills I have. I have not wanted to ask for any help over these past few years.
  It’s embarrassing and vulnerable to put myself out there like this,
  but I’m unable to keep doing what I’m doing, and I want to be as well
  as I can be while I patiently wait for my call on the transplant list.
  My financial burden is so heavy right now and has been building for
  quite some time. I need to pay off some existing hospital bills,
  doctor fees not covered by my insurance, be able to stay on my
  medication and pay for future procedures. However you can help, whether by donating or sharing with a
  community, it would be so appreciated. I know this is a hard time for
  everyone, and if you were considering getting me a gift for the
  holidays, please help fund my health instead :) Thank you, thank you,
  and… oh, yeah, thank you. With Much Love, Respect & Gratitude, Nick","20,005",of $24k goal,https://fundrazr.com/nickliverhelp,Help Nick with his Liver Disease Battle,249,,U.S. Dollar
"I am a breast cancer patient, involved in dog rescue and working
  part/full time, who desperately needs help to pay my chemotherapy
  co-payments!   In October, 2011, I was diagnosed with Stage ll Breast
  Cancer.  While undergoing my initial chemotherapy treatments, my Stage
  ll designation changed to Stage IV due to the fact that the cancer had
  metastasized to my bones! The following summer - 2012, I underwent a
  double mastectomy after which things seemed to be going fairly well
  until March of 2013 when (not even a year later) , during a routine
  exam, doctors discovered a new tumor.  I immediately began a much more
  aggressive chemotherapy treatments followed by radiation treatments. I followed this treatment program while still caring for over
  ten dogs in my home, continuing to be actively involved in rescue as
  well as working part/full time at my job. Unfortunately, I am alone
  here in the United States.  My Parents are living overseas, so I am
  all alone with no other source of financial help.  As you well know,
  chemotherapy and radiation can be a terrible drain on your health and stamina. I now have a total insurance co-payment due in the amount of
  $12,000, which represents a yearly $5,000 co-payment from 2011 through
  2013. For 2011 I payed $3000 off. An additional $5,000 co-payment
  will start in 2014. I have tried every which way to make ends meet, but I simply
  cannot afford to pay these outstanding balances to the hospital and to
  the doctors who have been involved in my care.  I've been haunted by
  calls from collection agencies and I am now at my wits end. If anyone reading this message can spare even the smallest
  amount towards a fund which would be used solely to meet these
  outstanding co-payments, this would be such a blessing.  I have to
  worry about paying my hospital bills while I am fighting for my life! Please, if you can afford anything at all to help me by
  contributing to this fund, I will be so very, very grateful. Thank you and may God bless you for your kind generosity and give you

"Camino de Santiago The Camino de Santiago is an ancient pilgrimage route that runs
  through northern Spain and dates back to pre Christian times. This is
  one of the holiest and most popular pilgrimages in the world.
  According to the Christian tradition, the remains of St James, one of
  the Apostles, rest at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in
  Galicia, Spain. Legend also has it that the Camino lies along the ley
  lines, under the Milky Way. Each year, thousands of Christians, non-Christians, atheists,
  basically just about anyone from all over the world walk, run, ride or
  bike the Camino. Traditionally, many Europeans just walked out of
  their homes and started walking towards Santiago. Over time, many
  popular routes have emerged. The most popular is the Camino Frances or
  the French Way, which starts at St Jean Pied de Port, goes over the
  Pyrenees and continues towards Santiago in Spain. This route is about
  800 km or 500 miles. Interesting fact, the first Camino guide book
  'Codex Calixtinus' was written in the 12th century! Even St Francis is
  believed to have walked the Camino. Since the 80's, it has become
  increasingly popular. There are many books and movies on it including
  'The Way' and 'I'm Off Then'. Why am I walking the Camino The Camino first entered my consciousness a little over a year ago. I
  cannot remember how, perhaps a fleeting comment made by someone,
  perhaps something I read somewhere. I honestly could not tell you. I
  can tell you this though. Over the past year/ year and a half, the
  Camino has been calling me. It started popping up everywhere! At a
  dinner conversation, as an inflight movie....the Camino was everywhere
  and was calling my name. I am a practicing Hindu and Pranic Healer. I meditate, I pray, I go
  the temples, I do poojas, I light diyas. I am more spiritual than
  religious.  My faith and my spirituality are important to me. We were
  raised to be open minded, curious and respectful of all cultures and
  religions. My upbringing and my Pranic Healing training allow me to
  inclusive, where I can be a Hindu who also enjoys and appreciates
  rites and rituals from other traditions. I am drawn to the Catholic
  tradition, to Rome and the Vatican. Pilgrimages are a big part of a
  Hindu's life but, until now, I haven't felt the calling to do one. The
  Camino is calling my name and I have decided to answer the call. I
  will walk the final stage of the Camino Frances from O Cebriero to
  Santiago, in north western Spain, in April 2017. This final stretch is
  160 km or 100 miles long. Supporting my Camino; Advancing scientifc research on Pranic Healing Pranic Healing (a form of energy healing)  has been such a large part
  of my life for the past 10 years. It has nourished and strengthened my
  spiritual practice. It has deepened my love and appreciation for my
  own religion and culture and the world we live in. It has broadened my
  horizons. I have bounced back from illness, injury, heartbreak and
  other life challenges, big or small.... each time, stronger and
  better, thanks to Pranic Healing. My family has also had similar
  experiences. My friends have benefited from healings. So out of
  tremendous gratitude to GMCKS, I would like to raise money to support
  the scientific research, both underway and planned, to gain empirical
  evidence and scientific proof on the results and effects of Pranic
  Healing. This work will help in so many ways including opening up
  Pranic Healing to a broader community, legitimizing Pranic Healing so
  that someday soon insurance companies will pay for Pranic Healing treatments. For more information on Pranic Healing, visit www.pranichealingusa.com I am grateful for your support!

"Written diligently on my phone over many hours as we are presently
  without a working computer in our home... Hey All- While it seemed that nothing but fake news was all that one could
  find wherever one looked, my world just got very real with some
  information regarding my health. Briefly, here is the gist of it all... Recently I've been struggling with issues of balance and hearing and
  was referred to a neurologist and subsequently to have an MRI of my head. These scans revealed a growth on my right side, and I was diagnosed
  with a vestibular schwannoma. So, what is that anyway? I know, it sounds like a sandwich, but in fact is a slow growing
  tumor originating off of my auditory nerve. Sometimes called an auditory neuroma, these growths are considered
  pretty rare overall. The good news is that it is self-contained and benign. The growth is not actually in my brain, but rather beginning to press
  on various nerves which are associated with my ability to walk,
  balance and function particularly affecting my right side. Apparently this thing has been growing for  20-30 years and first
  began to reach a size to where its presence affected the
  aforementioned nerves a few short months ago and has me to the point
  of my  not getting around that well. Given the size of the tumor and the ways it is impacting my life, the
  best option is a surgery to remove the growth. Eventually, if not removed or somehow reduced in size, the tumor will
  continue its slow but steady growth and my functionality will decrease
  and at some point my brain will run out of room to accommodate this
  impeding guest. This could be another 20-30 years but I am already experiencing
  significant loss of my abilities and quality of life. I am a total proponent of our own innate abilities to reduce and/or
  reverse growths and such in our bodies and surgery has been something
  that I've shied away from even until recently. Hell, I've spent most of the last 20+ years working tirelessly to
  hold this perspective for clients who have lost sight of these very truths. That said, I still come from the same place but am humbly, after much
  inner dialogue, choosing to go ahead with the surgery. Honestly I reached this decision after realizing that I lacked a
  certain strength and really needed help. The surgery is scheduled for the morning of the 12th and will take
  about 5 hours. This is unfamiliar ground for me, as it surely is for most. I am pretty scared and well out of my comfort zone! Following the surgery, my stay in the hospital should only be 3-5
  days with a possible indeterminate time at an in-patient rehab
  facility thereafter. The length of time at the rehab will depend on how well and quickly I
  can recalibrate and recover my abilities to balance and walk, etc... As far as recovery and returning to work, I'm being told a month
  depending on how I respond. The other day I had the occasion to speak with a local woman who
  underwent basically the same procedure a few years ago and she related
  it taking almost 3 months before she was feeling ready to get back to
  her job. Everyone is different and each case unique, I get that.  What I mean
  to say is that there are many unknowns... Hence my creating this campaign to ask for your financial assistance. I have not worked in at least a month, and it's been 2 or more since
  I've done anything full time. Fortunately I do have insurance, albeit limited coverage, through my
  wife's employer, but the bills are already beginning to wrack up. With doctor visits, running here and there, plus 2 MRIs the costs are
  already well beyond our means with the surgery, hospital stay and
  potential rehab yet to come. I'm not going to endlessly post asking for your assistance. If you can or want to donate towards this, cool. And if you can't or don't want to, also cool. Share or don't share as you see fit, both are good. I'm not going to make any promises here  that could come around to
  weigh upon me should I be unable to fulfill them. Please don't be put off by the goal, as this  amount was only set to
  not limit our cause here. Of course anything offered is a great gesture of kindness and totally appreciated! Lastly, I really hope to impart that what is most relevant and
  welcomed is your words and love during this time. Yes the money piece is important, and something that really takes a
  lot of my energy as I worry about that side of things  but what I
  truly seek right now is connection with those I love. If you are reading this then in some way you fall into that category. I'm not very communicative especially on social media, and definitely
  even less so as of late. I wasn't in the right awareness until now to fully disclose all that
  I've been dealing with. Part of my way of addressing things is to reach further into my own
  depths for understanding. Sometimes this can be interpreted as polarizing or dismissive but I
  assure you this has not been my intention. I'm simply trying to be okay, like we all are. I guess I'm a stoically private guy when it comes to my personal
  life, but for those who do have interest I wanted to share some of
  what's been going down with me. Peace and Thank You, Howard","2,655",of $11.3k goal,https://fundrazr.com/01EjG6,Help for Howard,21,,U.S. Dollar

  unrecognisable in a ward bursting with other young children fighting
  for their lives. Upon arriving at the hospital, Eve was taken in and cared for by the
  magical staff and nurses of Ward 7. The procedures and life-saving
  treatment that Eve required were terrifying for both Eve and her
  family, however the miraculous nurses and medical staff were
  constantly on hand 24 hours a day to help with their calming and
  loving nature, somehow helping to make the six week stint in a stark
  hospital bed bearable. These people dedicate their lives to ensure the
  young children that enter the ward have the very best chance of making
  it out in full health, so we want to give something back. EVEolution has been set up to help the staff and patients of Ward 7
  to improve the facilities on the ward to allow children fighting this
  deadly disease and their families find some sort of comfort and solace
  throughout this stressful time. If you would like to help us make a difference we would be forever
  grateful knowing that with your generous support we have made a
  difference to help future children like Eve and their families having
  to battle through this terrifying experience. When you are smacked in
  the face with a heartbreaking matter such as Eve's we know it would
  make a difference to find a little more comfort in an alien environment. We will keep you up to date with projects on our twitter and Facebook page.

"Hello, my name is Gabrielle Jones Price. Those of you who know my
  sister, Wendy will know me as Gabby. My hope is that those who don't
  know me or my sister continue to read on. No one is a stranger when it comes to suffering or struggles in life
  -- it is the one thing we all have in common as a human family and
  that is why I am here to ask for assistance in my family's time of need. Wendy's husband has been suffering with the sudden onset of a severe
  health issue, diagnosed as possible Crohn's disease. No one seems to
  know with certainty why he has lost a startling amount of weight --
  enough that I have been asked not to share recent photos of him. Even
  the precious photos of them together with my niece going to her first dance. I've done fundraising for activists, organizations and friends in
  need. I sit here heartsick for them and want to turn this feeling of
  helplessness into helpfullness. My sister's family is beautiful, fun-loving, respected and active. My
  brother-in-law was especially active before his diagnosis: playing
  tennis, traveling for work in sports media, boating, swimming and golf
  to name a few of his favorite things. He has been instructed to bed
  rest for several weeks. As a sportsman, this is like being benched or
  put in a penalty box. Unable to stand for long periods, he's also not
  allowed to work. This alone I'm certain is a major source of
  frustration for him. He's a great cook, a terrific father, adores my sister and we share a
  love for sarcasm and humor. This illness is incredibly challenging for
  all of them. It is difficult with the stress of bills mounting, no
  insurance and trying to keep my niece in good spirits approaching her
  birthday. [She's on the autism scale and a bouyant ray of light to all
  of us. For Aunt Gabby, this is as much for her wellbeing as her parents.] My big sister always watched over me when I came along. Full of
  advice [often when I didn't ask for it...big sisters are like that]
  but I've always been able to count on her whenever the chips were down
  and the need was dire. She shows up. I want to show up for her. She probably won't like that I'm doing
  this but I know what it's like to be in a difficult place, to swallow
  pride and ask for help when it's most needed. And it is most needed
  for her family. So I am calling on my friends, her friends, his
  friends, all collegues and any angel donor that can help fill this
  need. Let's insure they're focused on his best of health instead of
  financial needs that often create undue stress on a family. I want to
  suprise them by lifting at least some of these burdens. I'll be offering incentives as we go...like a silent auction of sorts. My sister and I do things a little differently, butt heads on
  occassion but laugh easily at ourselves as much as each other. We were
  raised in a family of Beatlemaniacs, but her passion for their music
  and message she carried into her work is what I'd like to return: All you need is Love. Money helps, though! You may chose to donate any amount without
  participating in the auction. Updates are forthcoming and any family
  members, friends or colleagues are welcome to participate by sharing
  stories, anectdotes, etc. These will cheer them after the fundraiser
  is over and during his recovery from surgery. [If you're unable to
  donate but wish to offer a gift/service for auction, please contact me directly and we'll
  figure out a way to make it work.] Thank you all for helping this little sister's effort to pay it
  forward for her big sister. One Love ~ Gabby",600,of $7.8k goal,https://fundrazr.com/beatle_blessings,Medical Fund: Help Ease My Sister's Family Costs,6,,U.S. Dollar
"Hey folks, my name is Simon and I have been working as a musician and
  graphic artist around the world for the past 10 years... I am
  currently living in Cambodia and up until recently this has been a
  dream life: travelling; meeting amazing people; learning languages and
  building bridges through music and art. I like to inspire people with
  my energy and positivity on and off the stage. Usually it is a tough
  but rewarding life, as musicians and artists know... it's about
  finding the next gig! Recently I have had some health issues which
  caused a collapse for me onstage. After spending a lot of time being
  misdiagnosed, I finally found a great set of doctors here in the
  Kingdom of Cambodia, who have their patients best interest at heart.
  When i could no longer make money by playing music, I used my graphic
  design to make some side cash, however rainy season has just started
  here and one of the first victims was my computer. This has left me
  with no real way of being able to fund myself. Unfortunately now all
  of this has exhausted all of my funds and I am not in a position to be
  able to pay for the medical services that I so desperately need. I'm
  not one to ask for help if I can do things myself, but now I am need
  of help and that is what I am desperately asking for. I have a stomach
  ulcer caused by h. pylori infection which after a triple antibiotic
  treatment doesn't seem to be healing. On top of that I have recurring
  episodes of tachycardia ( very fast heart beat - 130bpm.) I need to
  raise about $1000 in total to pay for medical expenses such as
  upcoming heart tests and an endoscopy to check my stomach, as well as
  any medication needed. I have been stuck on my back for over 6 months
  now, and I really am struggling with this as I usually am full of
  energy and giving time to help others in need. Please, if you can help
  me at this low part in my life story, it would mean so much to me. My
  partner Darya is working as hard as she can to provide us both with
  food, rent and basic medicines.But as it is rainy season now, work
  isn't as avaiable. I dont really need help to replace my material
  things, I can use my own energy to do this. But I really need help to
  get on my feet, get better and get my energy back to replace them. I
  know that all I need is some medical help and I will be back at it
  again... that is my natural way. I am a fighter, but sometimes
  fighters need help - and that is what I am asking for.","1,180",of $1k goal,https://fundrazr.com/savesimonstays,Please help a musician play again,24,,U.S. Dollar
"My name is Sandra... Day by day, I grow more convinced that ECT is not an effective
  treatment, and that it does little more than provide a brief respite
  from depression, followed by despair and hopelessness . . . and
  potential damage to the brain."" Juli Lawrence '' healthyplace.com ect.org The doctors tell me I’m suffering from a progressive degenerative
  disease of the brain. They say it’s like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), but that
  can only be diagnosed after someone dies so they can’t know for sure. I’m fundraising in the hopes of being able to seek a second medical
  opinion, and, ideally, private medical care and relief from the
  intense pain. I’ve struggled for many years with depression. I don’t remember
  giving birth to my oldest son, or to my youngest last year. I was too
  sick to look after him when he was born. He was taken into care before
  they let his father have him. I became quite unwell and was eventually put into a psychiatric ward.
  The tablets seemed to work in the beginning. Then I was put on
  #venlafaxine (brand name #Effexor) which worked for a while. But I
  became unwell again. The doctors suggested electro convulsive therapy
  (ECT), or shock treatment, while I was still taking venlafaxine. They
  said that I’d benefit from it. They didn’t explain the potential
  serious side effects. My last ECT session was over three months ago. After more than 16
  treatments I’ve been left with severe memory loss, brain damage, and
  nerve damage. It seems like I’m getting worse, starting to forget how
  to do the most basic things. The doctors refuse to send me for a CT
  scan. They say it would damage more cells and cause more brain damage.
  When I asked to see a neurologist they also refused that request. I’m determined to fight this for my children, myself, and anyone else
  who may have been hurt by ECT. I began doing research. It seems as
  though patients taking venlafaxine should not get ECT. OOPS! The good
  news is that there might be hope in the form of a stem cell
  transplant. I won’t know if that could work for me unless I can see a
  neurologist privately. Can you please help me pay for private medical treatment? I know most
  of us are struggling, and I don’t mean to sound like that shop . . .
  but every bit does help, no matter how small. Thank you so much for reading my story. And I want to say a special
  thanks to my Twitter friends for all the support and kindness they’ve
  shown me—including some help with telling my story here.",858,of £2k goal,https://fundrazr.com/61AfU6,Please Help Me To Pay For Medical Costs,32,,Pound Sterling
"Twelve times a minute, 24/7 this father gently inflates the black bag
  that breathes oxygen into his son. If he were to stop for more than a
  few minutes, the paralysed child dies. This is brutal reality of
  Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), a disease most of us have never even
  heard of. I certainly hadn't heard of it until summer 2006, where out of the
  blue, while living in Prague, I was left in similar dire straights as
  the child above except I was lucky to have access some of the best
  care available. Of course medical care is only one aspect of dealing
  with the devestating effects of GBS, my support network of friends and
  family were equally vital to to my lengthy journey of recovery. GBS is triggered by infections and affects 100,000 people per annum
  worldwide of all ages, sexes, religions and races. Right now, the ZIKA
  virus that is spreading like wildfire across the world, especially
  Latin America is triggering thousands of extra cases of GBS that are
  going virtually unnoticed on the global health scale. The harsh reality for many of the people affected by this current
  epidemic, like the poor child in the picture, is that they will not
  have access to the great medical care that we in the UK are used to
  and in some cases this inevitably leads to death. Last year I was lucky enough to marry my amazing wife Aideen. Like
  many of my nearest and dearest friends, we met through the shared love
  of Brazilian music. For over 15 years we have played in various bands
  and taken an interest in Brazilian culture from Samba in Rio to the
  Marcacatu and Forro of Pernambuco in the North East. We managed to
  fulfil a long term dream for us both this year by visiting Brazil for
  our honeymoon. I expected the trip to be full of excitement and adventure but I did
  not expect to see increasing headlines and warnings about Zika and its
  link to my rare illness! It seemed like a crazy coincidence
  and I shrugged it off until my Facebook thread was filled with videos
  of my old consultant on BBC and SKY News talking about the terrible
  effects of GBS. After sending him a small message to say what a great
  job he was doing I found out he was to land in Recife, the epicentre
  of the epidemic, the day we were leaving. The omens were building! It's been ten years since I discovered GBS by accident and one
  hundred years since Georges Guillain and Jean-Alexandre Barré the two
  scientists/doctors made the important initial discovery during the
  Battle of the Somme. For many reasons this year seems like a good year
  to try to help those who need it the most. There are clinics in Brazil
  and Columbia that are desperate for financial help and I promise that
  all monies raised will go to those who can make a difference and not
  get soaked up by the sometime corrupt nature of the governments that
  so far have been unable to help their own people. The worldwide Centenary Symposium on GBS is being held in Glasgow on
  Friday 24 June 2016, 100 miles south-east from our Tea Garden on
  Kerrera. As a finale to our fundraising drive, we promise to donate
  100% of the profits from the cafe on the previous day and I will
  announce the total amount raised via Skype live to the meeting in
  Glasgow. This broadcast will be streamed around the world. In the
  meantime, we hope that those with a little to spare can make a small
  donation that will help those most in need.","4,285",of £5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/716nC7,Kerrera Tea Garden Zika-GBS Appeal,141,,Pound Sterling

  beginning to blossom before it took a detour none of us were

"A mother’s first fear is a Childs first scrape and boo boo on
    the knee. A mother’s first tear is when they say, ""I love you
    mommy."" Myself and my husbands biggest fear was our worst
    reality for our 22 month old son. Talib disappeared when our backs
    were turned for a second. On March 1, 2014 our beautiful baby boy,
    full of life, love, and charisma was found face up in the backyard
    of our family pool. My husband asked me, ""Babe is Talib with
    you?"" I said ""No, I thought he was with you."" Our
    little adventurer loved to go in his uncles room to throw things
    everywhere; so that’s the first place I checked. Meanwhile, my
    husband checked the garage, thinking maybe someone went out and
    didn’t shut the door properly. I checked the bathroom because our
    little tiker loved to throw qtips in the toilet. So, I was sure he
    would be in there; he wasn’t!  I heard a loud scream like no other
    that came from my husband. He yelled ""OH MY GOD!!! OH MY
    GOD!!!"" I yelled frantically saying ""What!"" ""What!"" I was hoping he fell, got a scrape and was bleeding terribly
    and would need stitches. My heart was racing. I felt a bulge in my
    throat. I then walked towards the French doors facing the back of
    the house that were always so beautiful because it engaged the pool
    in such a way that it was enticing; even for me as it was for our
    little one. My baby was lifeless and blue floating at the top of the
    water. My husband jumped in and pulled him out, we were jumping
    around screaming and crying, I was ready to except my child on the
    ground lifeless and blue with an extended stomach and no heart beat.
    While my 7yr old son Isaiah, who is Talib's older brother screamed
    in the background of my clouded thoughts ""IS MY BABY BROTHER
    DEAD?"" ""HE CANT SWIM MY BABY BROTHER IS DEAD!!!!"" My
    husband’s cousins were at the house; one of them took Isaiah inside
    the house, the other was on the phone with 911. Everything was
    moving so fast, but a calm came over me. I kneeled down on my knees
    and I began to give my child mouth to mouth resuscitation. The calm
    was God telling me not to give up. I got on the phone with dispatch;
    I'm sure the women on the other end had heard the  scream. When I
    was placed on the phone she kept saying, ""I don’t want to speak
    with you, your'e too emotional."" I said to her, ""Maam this
    is my baby we're talking about!"" ""I am ready to take
    instructions."" She said to press down on the chest three times
    and then blow in the mouth. I was scared because before I had gotten
    on the phone with her I was just pressing on the chest and blowing
    as much air as I could as the water gargled out of his lifeless
    body. Before I could even follow the dispatch instructions, the EMT
    arrived in record timing. EMT was there giving him immediate oxygen
    and pushing epinephrine to restart his heart. They told my husband
    and I to follow after them. That was the journey that we started on
    March 1, 2014 that changed the course of our little toddlers life.

    hearts that your loving hands and humble spirits find the time and
    generosity to donate whatever  you have from a penny to infinity

"On August 3rd, Jim was un-expectantly hospitalized after severe chest pain and shortness of breath while enroute to a concert in Central Park. Immediately, the doctors recognized symptoms of a heart attack and diagnosed his significant cardiac failure in two areas of his heart. He underwent emergency heart catheterization to open his main coronary artery that was blocked 99%. This procedure saved his life. At the time, they also found another artery in the back of his heart that was occluded 95%. Instead of fixing that during his first hospital stay they wanted to be sure his heart was strong enough and required him to rest for a several weeks first. His cardiologist declared him medically unable to continue his current work as a Marriage and Family Therapy Associate / Drug and Alcohol counselor near his current home in Bethpage, a Long Island suburb of NYC. He is currently at home resting, and considering God s wake-up call on his life while awaiting this second procedure which should be done in mid-September. The timing of this incident left him in quite a predicament financially as his medical coverage insuring his care through his MFT Masters ended soon after graduation (May 2013) and expected coverage with current employer had not yet begun. He had also exhausted his savings after paying for two years of schooling and his recent move to his own small studio apartment. Thankfully it seems that the hospital and his former insurance are finalizing arrangements to cover most expenses of both emergency hospitalization and the medically necessary 2nd procedure. His prognosis for cardiac health and an extended life are very good! It Jim s hope is to add considerably to his 29 years of Christ-centered dedicated ministry. Through the generous aid of family and friends Jim s financial needs have been met for the majority of his August expenses. THANK YOU SO MUCH! The short-term, temporary concern is meet the next 60 days financial needs of his studio apartment rent ($1000), utilities ($150-200), transportation ($250), Rx costs ($600), groceries and ancillary medical expenses.

    great outdoors his entire life. Hunting, fishing, gardening, lawn

    hard time wrapping my head around what that actually meant, but I

    in nature. When I first watched a video of someone trying on the

  to do both of these things while being extreamly color blind with both Red and Green tones.  He can put
  together a killer lighting design, pull great color palets for set
  design and what is really amazing, he blends wide ranges of colors and
  highlights in fine detail on the mini table top games all without
  really being able to see the colors he is using. (see more pictures
  below). The only color he really can see is yellow. What a ability he has
  to adapt to his surcimstances and be sucessful in his career and hobbies. I would love for Nick to be able to see what he creates and be able
  to see how truely talented he is.  This funding campaing alowes those
  who know Nick to give him an meaningful gift to really see what he has
  done and what he has been capible of. If you know nick or have a chance to see his work please take a

  has.    We have a $700 goal which is more then the basic cost of the

"Hello everyone. My name is Tyler. I am colorblind. Being colorblind
  is not very much fun. Do you how much stuff is in color? A lot. I live
  by myself, which is very nice. Sometimes I like to cook, which is also
  nice. But I can't see how well-cooked anything is, that is not so
  nice. I think my cat might be able to see colors, but she is not very
  useful most of the time so I don't think I can rely on her to help me cook. This is my cat, Juanita, who is cute, I'll admit, but not what I
    would call a team player. Driving also sucks. If there's a blinking single light and I'm
  driving towards it I don't know what color it is. Sometimes I'm lucky
  and there's someone in front of me who will either drive through it or
  stop, and I follow their lead. But if I'm in the lead of a bunch of
  cars or by myself, what am I supposed to do? Most of the time I stop
  anyway, but if there's a car behind me when I think the light is a
  yellow and I stop for what they think is no reason, they get very mad
  and honk. There are a lot of other reasons to not want to be colorblind. Some
  people have very pretty eyes, I can see blue ones and brown ones and
  that is it. I have dated some people with green eyes, and my mom has
  green eyes too. I'd like to be able to see green eyes. Red is supposed to be a beautiful color, I'd like to see that too. I
  would also like to not have to answer questions from people about what
  color things are once they find out I'm colorblind. The answer to all
  of those questions is always: I'm not sure, I'm colorblind, please
  leave me alone. But apparently this is a rude answer to give, so I
  play along. I'd like to not have to do that anymore. If I get these glasses I'll take a video of me wearing them for the
  first time so we can all feel good about helping a disabled person
  because helping disabled people is a really nice thing to do. Maybe
  I'll cry in the video because everything is so pretty. People cry in
  those videos a lot, you know? It'll be like an old man in a chair
  looking at some balloons and he'll get all teary-eyed and someone will
  say Awww from behind the camera and it's usually pretty cute.
  Plus, like I said, there are always balloons in those videos and I
  want to know if EnChroma sends balloons with the glasses, because
  that'd be pretty neat if they did, but I don't know. Help me partake in capitalism by letting me see why red is used so much. Anyway, if you all could give a few dollars to support a guy who
  would really like to know what the fuss is all about with colors, I'd
  much appreciate it. I'd like a pair of these things that are in my
  prescription so I wouldn't have to choose between seeing colors and
  seeing anything at all. That will run me $499 before tax. If I could
  not have to pay the full $499 plus tax I think that'd be pretty swell. Thank you all and enjoy your day. -Tyler",535,of $499 goal,https://fundrazr.com/d1FtS9,Colorblind dude wants to cook and drive safely,12,,U.S. Dollar
"I am hosting this fundraiser on behalf of my friend Ricard
    Zenarosa. This is his story: ""Nearly seventeen years ago, my son Nathan Zenarosa was
    born with a bilateral cleft lip and palate; and a hole in his heart. Thankfully when he was two years old the hole in his heart
    closed on its own, but the opening in his lip and palate prevented
    him from feeding/eating normally as he grew up. While we were still
    in the Philippines, he had to endure bullying and ridicule on a
    daily basis. He has had numerous operations to try to close the openings of
    his upper lip and palate, align his teeth so that they grow in the
    correct space and add bone grafts to the gaps in his gums. After all
    these surgeries, the opening in his palate continues to be an issue
    because it reopens as he grows older and bigger over the years. Nathan is scheduled for an operation on May 24 that will be a
    major step forward. It has the following procedures: Realignment of his upper jaw (maxillary) Realignment of his lower jaw (mandibular) Malar augmentation to offset realignment of the upper jaw Genioplasty to offset realignment of the lower jaw Closure of the opening of his palate The remarkable thing is that procedure 3 and 4 are considered
    cosmetic and are not covered under the Medical Services Plan (MSP),
    with an estimated cost of $7,000. While it is possible to not do
    these 2 steps, the idea that we would not do the best that we can
    for our son seems inconceivable. How could we subject him to this
    operation and then have the result compromised just because the
    expense is beyond our means? I am asking for your help in contributing to funding this
    portion of the upcoming operation and to spread the word about this
    campaign through your social network and contacts.  Any help would
    be greatly appreciated by Nathan and our whole family. Thanks you very much Richard Zenarosa"" Cleft lips and palates are the most common craniofacial
    malformations of newborns. It occurs when there is a failure of
    closure of the lips and bones of the palate. Serious feeding and
    airway problems occur and this leads to undernourishment and
    recurrent lung infections. Numerous surgical repair procedures are
    required to correct this problem.","4,673",of $5.1k goal,https://fundrazr.com/81Evp8,Help Fund Nathan Zenarosa’s Jaw Surgery,61,,Canadian Dollar

"My name is Barbara Deering.  I am an actor and a private music and
  acting teacher.  My family and I live in the Seattle area.  This
  campaign is for my daughter Lotus. Lotus is a beautiful, kind, loving woman. She has been diagnosed with breast cancer. She is only 42. Lotus is the mother of 3 and a major bread winner in her household. Lotus had insurance with a company who pulled out of Washington and
  she is no longer covered for her surgeries, chemo, radiation or drug
  treatments.  Her ability to work, cleaning houses for others, will be
  greatly impacted for the year ahead.  This is not work you can do
  while sheltering your system from bacteria and viral infections. Her first surgery was the 20th of March.  Following surgery we took
  her on the family vacation we had planned all year. When we returned,
  she had to have a second surgery before her chemo, radiation and drug
  treatments began.  The second surgery was also not complete so
  following her chemo she will undergo a third before radiation begins.
   She is expected to be in treatment until Thanksgiving. I am hoping to raise money which would allow her to rest and focus on
  getting well and being with her family until her health is restored.
   The ability to continue paying the bills she has always covered,
  groceries, electric, water, insurance and activities for her children
  will help us continue to create a steady home environment for her and
  her younger children as she battles her cancer.  On top of these she
  now has to shoulder the expense of her treatments and surgeries. For anyone not wanting to use an on line format, I am opening an
  account at Key Bank in her name for this purpose.  The account name is
  Standing With Lotus. We appreciate any gift you feel led to share.  Your prayers are
  equally as important and valuable. I will post updates as her
  treatment progresses.  Thank you for your generosity. God Bless.","3,998",of $25k goal,https://fundrazr.com/11DXv7,Help Support Lotus As She Battles Breast Cancer.,36,"Dec 31, 2017",U.S. Dollar

      was just something they had to live with until we heard about

      can see like other people do! He loves the outdoors, is always outside skateboarding, riding
      bike, playing football or fishing.  He's pretty artistic too, he
      draws, paints, and has even made some pretty cool sculptures.   He
      has hand made skateboards and fishing lures, I help him with
      colors for painting them but he would really like to be able to do
      it all by himself.  His dad works on boats and he likes working
      with him.  It's important to be able to see colors when working
      with electronics and he'd like to work with his dad.  If you would
      be willing to help, I would be so grateful and someday, maybe we

"This fundraiser is to help raise funds to cover the expenses related
  to obtaining and training a service dog prospect to replace my current
  service dog. As many of my friends and family know, my current service dog
  Sonakih is amazing in every way, she gives 100% all the time, she has
  been the most amazing companion and help to me.  But due to her own
  health, after a scary bought with pneumonia that left her unable to
  help me for several weeks earlier this year, and me having to really
  struggle to do the things she normally assists me with made me realize
  how much I truly need her help, and the harsh reality that I really do
  need a dog that can serve as her backup to assist me during the times
  Sonakih is unable to, as well as do some tasks that due to her health
  and smaller size Sonakih is unsuitable for. Here are the expected expenses related to obtaining and training
  the puppy.  The breeder has generiously offered to donate the puppy,
  but the expenses to get her from Georgia to Utah still need to be
  raised. - Health Certificate, exam, and pre-flight paperwork
  from vet - $75 - Airline approved shipping crate $50 -
  Flight from Atlanta, Georgia to SLC, Utah - $275 - Puppy, basic,
  and advanced service dog training through Side by Side dog training -
  Free through 6 months, and an expected cost average of about $200 per
  month from 6 months to 2 years when she's ready to complete training
  as a service dog, so approx $3600 total.  (This is a very rough
  estimate, because of course she may progress faster or slower then
  average, and need more or less individual sessions ($80/session) then
  what this average cost was figured off of) - Training vest,
  patches, and eventually a specially fitted mobility assistance harness
  for when she's old enough to start mobility training - ~$600 Her breeder has generiously offered to donate the puppy herself,
  I just need to raise the expenses to get her here from Georgia, as
  well as pay for the training that will be needed to get her to fully
  trained service dog status.  It breaks my heart to be needing to train
  another service dog before my current dog is even 3 years old, but due
  to her health and limitations, I feel it's the best for both myself
  and my current service dog.  My service dog will continue to serve me
  until the time this puppy is fully trained and ready for duty, and
  having 2 dogs fully trained to assist me will allow me to give both
  dogs more breaks as needed for whatever reason since it's very
  difficult for me to even do basic things like grocery shopping without
  the assistance of my service dog. Keep in mind I loose about 10% of donations made through
  Fundrazr - If you would like to donate directly to avoid loosing as
  much in fees, you can donate through Paypal to poodle.momma@att.net or paypal.me/poodlemomma   I
  will update the donations made directly to keep the running total accurate. Please help me make this a reality and keep my independance and

"The Ria Fincham Cure and Recovery Fund Ria’s Story (Condensed version) In July 2012, Ria was experiencing severe back and head pain with
  fever. It quickly progressed to eye pain, unable to urinate, tingling
  in her extremities and paralyzation of her legs. She was rushed to Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura, CA, where
  her condition rapidly grew worse. Emergency room doctors gathered a
  neurologist, infectous disease doctor and several other physicians to
  quickly try to determine what was causing her these serious symptoms.
  They ran a battery of tests and administered a variety of i.v.
  steroids, part chemo and antibiotic medications as they thought it to
  be transverse myelitis after consulting with Mayo Hospital. Incoherent
  and shuddering with a high temperature in the hospital bed that first
  night she was admitted, I climbed in to her bed and held her. I
  thought Lord you laid her in my arms 24 years ago, I will hold her
  while she is alive one last time before you take her from me. I really
  wasn’t sure my little girl was going to make it through the night. All
  I could do was pray and hope the doctors were giving her the right
  treatments and she would pull through. The doctors declared that she
  had Transverse Myelitis a neurological disorder that creates rare
  inflammation, lesions and tissue and nerve damage and demyelation to
  your spinal chord. For 2 weeks in the hospital she was given all the
  treatments to try to restore the function she had lost in her bladder,
  bowel and her paralyzed lower body. Doctors and Therapists were able
  to get her walking again but they were unable to help restore her
  bowel and bladder to function on their own. But with recovery they
  said this would eventually improve. The day she was released she was
  so happy to be going home walking slowly with a walker and looking
  forward to recuperating at home. The worst was yet to come. August 7th 2012, I was summoned by her
  younger sister, to come home quickly as she had had another
  neurological attack only this time, the head pain felt like her head
  was being crushed down into her body and she had severe eye pain. We
  immediately went back to the same hospital and were met with a
  different group of attending doctors. All the same symptoms were back
  except this time it progressed to excrutiating eye and back pain,
  paralyzation of her legs and right arm with her hand curled in and
  frozen. An MRI showed that the lesions had spread to her brain and
  were worse in her spine. As her condition grew graver and had doctors
  stumped, they decided to transport her by ambulance to UCLA for
  further treatment and diagnostic testing. After an extensive barage of tests, (i.e. spinal taps, MRI, CRT, Pet
  Scans, Evoke Potentials and extensive bloodwork) it was the NMO IG-G
  test that came back positive for Neuromyelitis Optica a few days later
  after arriving at UCLA. Because the inflammatory response went in to
  overdrive more of her myelin was stripped from her spinal chord, she
  had longer lesions in her spine and her brain this time. We spent the
  next few months, getting treatment. Little did we know with all the
  countless plasmapherisis, ritux infusion, cortecortesoid treatments,
  etc that the damage had been done and we couldn’t reverse the damage.
  Her vision was spared, no blindness or retina or cornea damage and her
  arm function was restored. To date she has not regained the ability to
  walk and she suffers from bowel and bladder dysfunction, nerve pain,
  depression and fatigue to name a few. Her brain lesions have caused
  her memory loss and other cognitive problems, her dream of finishing
  college is on hold indefinitely. Her fiancé found this too much for
  him to cope with and called off their wedding when she was at UCLA in
  hospital rehab. Prior to her getting ill she had just been laid off
  from her job that was outsourced with countless other jobs in her
  department to a foreign country. Despite all these sad events
  unfolding, she had her tearful moments but was focused on beating this
  disease and fighting on! She is my HERO! Being a single mom, I didn’t
  know how strong of a young woman I had raised along with her younger
  sister, Kai. I’m blessed and honored to be their Mom. We weren’t home free, the complex health system, can shake you up if
  you’ve never been through the process of navigating and advocating for
  your loved one. We had a false sense of security and naïve about
  certain things that can affect the outcome of your loved one’s future
  health. But that’s another topic of discussion in a separate post. Ria
  is alive albeit still fighting this horrid unpredictable disease. Any
  future attacks, God forbid, would leave her with more injurious
  disabilities. We have been simply band aiding the symptoms with
  prescription medications that carry the risk of giving her more
  serious terminal s. diseases. So hear we are 2 years later, despite
  experts having clinical trials on medications that will disarm
  components in cells that reek havoc in your immune system look
  promising, most medicines don’t become available for at least 20
  years. Once they pass all the clinical trials then the FDA will
  finally or maybe approve. What complicates matters most, is that since
  NMO is rare there are only so many patients that become candidates or
  even want to volunteer for these trials. Results are slim and hard to
  compare to other data when your pool of NMO patients is smaller than
  the trials for more widely larger  populations of cancer or HIV
  patients. I applaud the medical experts who continue to do research in
  hopes of making the medicine that will cure NMO. One has stated that
  NMO will be the first autoimmune disease they will cure that exists
  amongst 400+ others. They have the definitive blood test IG-G that has
  the biomarkers for the disease. But the younger you are and if your
  disease has not met the neurodegenerative stage your chances of
  beating it are improved. If we wait 20 years for these medicines or
  the medicine that will cure NMO, Ria will be 46. With her current
  treatment there is no guarantee she won’t have another attack in a
  month, a year or 19 years down the road. Some NMO patients are
  “monophasic” and only have one attack; some have multiple relapsing
  NMO that subjects them to multiple eattacks. But there are no clear
  indicators if you are monophasic or relapsing since the course of the
  disease has no predictable course or stages. We can’t wait 20 years
  and we can’t wait for another attack. NMO has been like a ticking time
  bomb looming in the back of our minds, we have a drill like EMT’s
  waiting for the other shoe to drop. We as a family have to seek
  emergency treatment immediately . It’s no way to live. With the grace of God we were unknowingly searching for a cure and
  came across a patient organization fundraising manager that mentioned
  the work of DIAD.org – Division of Immunotherapy and Autoimmune in
  Diseases in Chicago. How did this escape my radar on all the countless
  late night web searches? I can’t even tell you how many medical pub
  journals online I’ve scoured for answers, a cure. Once we looked into
  the autologous stem cell treatment and what it involves we realized
  this is not for the faint of heart. Ria and I are a team but
  ultimately it was her decision to move forward and reach out to them
  for treatment. She is brave and wants to be clear of this so she can
  look to the future in working on rehab at Project Walk. We hope you will offer your support and donate so we can cover our
  expenses in traveling to the initial meeting with DIAD to see if she
  is a candidate. If she is, we will be staying in Chicago longer
  for the actual treatment. Our household will be on hold but the bills
  won’t be. Our fundraising goal is at least $50,000 for the treatment
  and to include any co-pays for the part our PPO insurance won’t pay as
  well. Prayers are welcome and appreciated. Thank you for your support. A Day in Ria’s Life Ria takes about 25 pills a day – immunosuppresant, pain, nerve, Gerd,
  esophogical and stomach medicine, anti spasmodic, anti-convulsant,
  anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, anti-biotic and a potassium channel
  blocker. IVIG infusions every 30 days.   Her arm veins are wearing
  thin due to so many infusions both in the hospital and home for 2 years. She eats breakfast, bathes, dresses and grooms with the help of her
  sister whom is her caretaker in the day, so Ria’s mom, Cindy can work
  her day job to keep the bills paid and her medical insurance coverage
  for her girls. In the evenings Ria is cared by her mother. Neither her
  sister or mother have any respite care or back up assistance. We even
  work when we are sick. Without her family’s care Ria would be
  institutionalized. Her family refuses to allow that to happen. Ria spends her time ordering durable medical supplies from vendors,
  fixing any problems with orders, making sure her insurance is covering
  medications, calling in her prescribed medication refills, speaking to
  her doctors about any new issues that may come about her illness,
  going to her doctor’s appointments, seeing her speech pathologist and
  attending physical therapy. She experiences UTI infections frequently
  due to her neurogenic bladder. Doctors usually have to try oral
  antibiotics first but the infections have grown in strenghth and
  frequency that she has to now have i.v. antibiotics to avoid the
  infection reaching her kidneys like it did in Sept 2013. She was
  admitted with Septicemia (blood poisoning from infection) to UCLA
  Ronald Reagan hospital with a temperature of 103 that wouldn’t come
  down despite doctors giving her all the right i.v. medications. We
  prayed as a family for God to help us and he heard our prayers 2 days
  later her fever broke. The infection was under control but she stayed
  another 3 days until infectous disease specialists were sure she had
  no more toxins in her blood. What a scare! She spends time with her family and does as much as she can for
  herself including caring for her Yorkie Bella.",883,,https://fundrazr.com/3pxVe,Ria Fincham NMO Cure & Recovery Fund,,,

"I'm raising money for my brother, Russell. Following a stroke 18
    months ago he has aphasia and is no longer able to speak. The NHS
    have been giving him speech therapy and he has made progress.
    However, now the NHS have stopped therapy so I am raising money to
    help pay for ongoing private speech therapy.  (I must add the NHS
    have been amazing, but have limited resource in Russell's area to
    support him further). Every penny you donate will go towards his rehabilitation, we
    are confident he can speak again. Russell is 36, his story is shocking and extraordinary - the
    doctors and specialist do not know what caused any of it.... Aged 23 Russell had a huge heart attack. He'd been windsurfing
    after work. Fit, healthy and very active the Dr's did not know what
    caused it to happen. He rang me during his heart attack, asking
    where our mum was, I told him he needed to ring 999. He survived, but one chamber of his heart was effectively dead.
    It took a year but he made a full recovery and got back to work,
    windsurfing, kitesurfing, cycling and more. In the 10th year after his heart attack Russell spent the year
    fund raising for the British Heart Foundation and raised a target of
    £10,000, the charity’s largest single fundraiser that year. 12 years after the heart attack, aged 35 with a clean bill of
    health and completely signed off by the Drs, he had a stroke. This time he was at work. The receptionist saw it happen and her
    quick actions probably saved his life. This was 2 months after
    Russell got married. Russell sustained huge damage to the brain. He lost all
    movement, speech and some memory. His movement and memory has
    eventually returned but his speech has not. The parts of the brain
    that control his speech are dead and will not regenerate. The rest
    of his brain is now learning those functions but the recovery
    process is long and incredibly hard. Imagine if you can, waking up and not being able to speak. Every
    day. His wife is amazing. With no speech Russell can’t work. He can’t
    drive for 12 months. Rachel supports him through a single income,
    has learnt how to communicate with him, is his interpreter and has
    been instrumental into his recovery. What a start to married life,
    they still haven’t been on a honeymoon! Luckily Russell has made a very good physical recovery. He is
    fitter than most people I know. Addicted to sport. He doesn’t flinch
    at 100 mile bike ride, he kitesurfs, surfs and windsurfs and is
    widely known as an athlete. But he can’t speak. So please help raise some money for Russell, every penny counts.
    He has had a rough ride and your support won’t go unnoticed. I’ll be participating in various cycling events over the summer
    all aimed at raising money for Russell. For every mile I cycle in
    these events I’ll donate £1. Thanks for your support, Russell, Pete and the rest of the Hanford’s.","6,826",of £4k goal,https://fundrazr.com/a181G4,Help Russell to speak again,197,,Pound Sterling

      c'mon get...hey wait where are you going!!! Terrible song written
      by a fictional T.V. family that isn't the Brady Bunch aside...I'm
      David! I have been involved with art since as long as I can
      remember. Drawing, singing, painting, whatever--if its about
      creating, I want to see it, experience it, or be a part of it in
      whatever way I can. Although my focus for the past 15
      years has been on being a musician, I have always wanted to expand
      my visual art capabilities but felt very discouraged after years
      of coloring things ""wrong"" in school and failing to
      successfully color my own pieces in a way that makes me happy. To
      all my fellow wierdos and free thinkers out there saying to
      themselves You don't need these things. It'll make your style more
      unique without them, and beside clashing can be rad"", lets be
      honest here, too much clashing is just plain emotionally
      uncomfortable and not being able to convey what you want in your
      own art is super frustrating and dissatisfying. I've started this campaign to
      finally realize my dream not only in the day to day things like
      appreciating flowers or the color changes of the leaves in the
      fall, but also so I can expand my abilities to create and be able
      to share those creations with the world! My goal is to raise enough for me

"Many people don't know this about
      me, but I have a red-green color vision deficiency known as
      deuteranomaly. It has not really affected my life very much (or so
      I thought) except for occasional mismatched clothes, confusion
      about color distinction and even having a car for years that I
      thought was one color only to eventually find out it was another.
      I work in the field of ophthalmology and am lucky enough to
      occasionally see patients at the only eye care facility in Texas
      that sells these new Enchroma glasses. I tried these on the other
      day after seeing all of the videos going around on the internet...
      Now I get it. I was blown away!! I saw colors that I have
      literally NEVER seen before. I saw rich color like I couldn't have
      even imagined. The trees alone... Wow! Anyways, I eventually had
      to give back the demo glasses that I tried. Now that I am back in
      the bland world that I've always lived in, I am continually aware
      of what I'm missing out on. I would love to get these and see in
      full color again, but they are very expensive and I would need an
      outdoor pair as well as an indoor pair as there are no
      transitional lenses with this technology yet.  This will end up
      being about $700. I saw the crowdfunding tool on the Enchroma
      website and thought, ""Hey, maybe it's not a bad idea to see
      if my family and friends want to help my color-blind self start
      seeing colors again!"" This is difficult to explain to someone
      who has no color deficiencies but what I saw was a game changer
      for my life. I don't want to miss out on anything in my future
      that will be full of color. If you want to contribute to that, I
      will be forever grateful to you. Thanks for reading my story

"Introduction Hello, and thank you for visiting my crowdfunding campaign page! My
  name is Esther Roth-Colson, and I'm a 31-year-old transgender woman
  originally from upstate New York but now living in St. Louis; I'm the
  producer for The RESIST Podcast , hosted by Danielle Muscato ; and I'm an autism acceptance,
  health insurance access and trans rights activist. Almost exactly a year ago, and after a lifetime of struggling with my
  identity, I came out as a trans woman at 30. I started presenting
  full-time in April 2016 and began hormonal treatment that May. It's
  been a long road since then, but I can honestly say that it's been one
  of the best decisions I've ever made in my life, and now I'm ready to
  start on the next part of this journey: an orchiectomy (removal of my
  testicles) as part of the surgical treatment for my gender/genital dysphoria. My health insurance will pay for the surgery itself, but current
  medical standards require two psychologist evaluations before the
  surgery can be scheduled and performed, and those appointments are not
  covered. After suffering a concussion in February 2017 and being
  hospitalized with complications, I have been unable to perform my
  previous work, and have been living on infrequently-paid disability
  payments since then. I was able to pay for the first psychologist evaluation, but the
  second one will likely cost around $300, and because of my current
  limited income this is a significant expense that is the last thing
  needed before the surgery can be scheduled. WIth the generosity of
  others, I hope to be able to complete this process and move forward on
  something that is extremely important to my mental health and well-being. Thank you very much for any support you may be able to offer! Background Like many trans women, I experience a significant level of gender
  dysphoria, including genital dysphoria. My eventual goal is to have
  full gender-confirming surgery (GCS), but due to some temporary health
  problems, that is still likely a couple of years away. However, one surgery that is available to me right now is an elective
  orchiectomy, which essentially means the removal of my testicles,
  which are a significant source of my genital dysphoria. My insurance will pay for the surgery itself, but there is still one
  significant cost associated with it. Before I can schedule the
  orchiectomy, the current standards for trans healthcare require that I
  receive approval from two independent psychologists to ensure that I
  am making a consensual and informed decision. This process is not covered by my insurance, and so requires
  out-of-pocket payments for each of the psychologists. I was able to
  pay for the first psychologist appointment, and she agreed to provide
  the approval. However, the second psychologist appointment will likely
  cost approximately $300, and as someone receiving disability (and
  infrequently at that, due to the disability insurance company's
  frequent delays), this is a large expense to come up with. A Bit About Myself I'm now 31 years old and live in St. Louis, where I moved in November
  2016. Until February 2017, I worked as an analyst for the federal ACA
  Health Insurance Marketplace (AKA HealthCare.gov), a job that I had
  since November 2013. Unfortunately, a concussion that I suffered
  earlier this year in a household accident has left me with
  post-concussion syndrome that causes dizziness and speech problems,
  preventing me from doing my previous job at this time. Since January, I've also been the producer for The RESIST Podcast, a
  weekly podcast hosted by my friend and fellow trans woman, Danielle
  Muscato, which was launched officially in March. The podcast focuses
  on practical steps that can be taken to resist the effects of a Donald
  Trump administration, fascism and white supremacy. Outside of those areas, I also have a long history of activism on
  various topics, such as health insurance access, autism acceptance,
  LGBTQIA+ rights, and in particular, trans right. If you'd like to connect with me on social media, you can find me on Facebook , and on Twitter, @erothco . Updates Once I am able to schedule the assessment and, then, the surgery, I
  will be posting updates so that all donors can see the progress being made!",385,of $350 goal,https://fundrazr.com/31EGN6,Orchiectomy Consultation Fund,16,,U.S. Dollar
"As many of you know I suffer from clinical depression. I have
    tried many treatments — from SSRI medications to electro-shock which
    all have terrible side-effects.  None of my past treatments have
    provided me relief. After doing research, I found that there is extensive research
    and treatment being done now with the drug ketamine.  For many
    sufferers, like me, it is the only effective treatment for recurrent
    major depression.  There are many articles outlining its positive
    effects (e.g. http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/20/520169959/ketamine-for-severe-depression-how-do-you-not-offer-this-drug-to-people ) ""How effective can ketamine be? It has been shown to relieve the
  kind of depression that no other drugs can affect. It's lifted even
  suicidal depression in just hours. With studies into ketamine going on
  for over a decade, a recent statement from the American Psychiatric
  Association says there is “compelling evidence” that it works…"" After a recent crisis I have decided to try Ketamine Infusion
  Therapy. I had a very good experience with my first treatment, and I
  am feeling hopeful that this therapy will finally turn things around
  for me. Currently Ketamine is not covered by insurance as a treatment
  for depression. This means that nothing will be covered by insurance
  and all expenses are entirely out-of-pocket. I am traveling from San Jose to Modesto, CA where the treatment is
  offered. This is additional expense. As a new graduate student with no
  income this will be a challenge for me. My goal here is to raise
  $9,000 to cover 12 months’ worth of treatments. Anything raised beyond
  that target will go toward the ongoing maintenance treatments. Please
  share and spread the word and let’s see if we can exceed the target goal. My sincere thanks for anything you can do to help me finally overcome
  this debilitating disease which has plagued me for too long.",100,of $9k goal,https://fundrazr.com/61EFW8,Ketamine Infusion Therapy,1,,U.S. Dollar

"Stand in solidarity with the Unist'ot'en
  Clan and their commitment to stopping all fossil fuel
  pipelines and to healing and decolonization. Their Territory is
  located about half way between Prince George and Prince Rupert in
  northern British Columbia. Numerous bitumen and fracked gas pipelines
  are proposed to cross this land. The Northern Gateway bitumen pipeline
  may or may not be stopped. But industry and government are also
  pushing ahead with several fracked gas pipelines. (The life cycle
  carbon footprint of fracked gas is similar to that of tar sands bitumen.) Many people first get involved with the Unist'ot'en
    Camp because their stance is clear - there will be no
    pipelines built on this land. But they soon realize that the Camp is
    much more than this. It is a place of learning, of healing, of
    connecting with nature, of breaking with the legacy of colonization. For seven years now the Unist'ot'en Camp has
    stood as a bastion against fossil fuel pipelines - no pipeline work
    has been allowed on their Territory.  The Camp also continues to develop as a healing community with an all season bunk house , a permaculture garden and an under construction Healing Lodge. The Unist'ot'en Healing Lodge ​will have indigenous youth as its main focus. With the generous support of people like you, the kitchen and
    dining hall are already complete and being used every day. This

  unit here in Polegate, East Sussex and the ICU ward at the Eastbourne
  District General Hospital. Steve was a 41 year old positive unwell soul. Diagnosed with diabetes
  at 7 he lead a controlled life of keeping himself well but
  unfortunately lost his sight at 31 when Kaitlyn was 3 years old. Steve
  later lost feeling in his feet and required  dialysis 3 times a week
  while waiting for an organ transplant for over 3 years. On Saturday 28th May while at dialysis he called Kaitlyn to say he
  was looking forward to her staying over as she did every Saturday
  evening after swim squad.  It was after this precious telephone call
  that Steve's heart stopped and this would then take him over 20 mins
  to be resuscitated from this. Unfortunately just under a week later
  the hospital informed us Steve was just not able to recover and we had
  to say goodnight to him. Our thoughts are not of anger or resentment. We know Steve had a
  different life to most but he was always positive, kind, very generous
  and just wanted the best for everyone. His lovely parents have lost

"6 years ago my mom had a hysterectomy. As part of the pre-op, they
  did a full body x-ray. There was a small spot on her left lung, but no
  one noticed it. Fast forward to February, 2016. My mom thought she was
  having a heart attack and drove herself to the hospital. Fortunately,
  it was just an anxiety attack and she was fine. But as a precaution,
  they did some tests including a chest x-ray. And there it was. THE SPOT . Only it was bigger now.... a full blown tumor . That's when they pulled her
  x-rays from 6 years ago and saw it. Knowing it's been there for 6
  years and no one caught it is really hard to swallow. But my mom and I
  have decided to let that anger go. For the last few months my mom has
  gone through a lot of tests....2 dye injections, a colonoscopy (there
  was a possibility the cancer had spread there), a lung capacity test,
  CAT scans and MRIs. It was hard being 3,000 miles away and not being
  able to be there for her. She had to drive herself to all those
  appointments....alone. But I've finally made it home after 6 long days
  of driving across the country. The GOOD NEWS after all those tests is that the
  doctors feel pretty confident that the cancer has NOT spread!! The BAD
  NEWS is that in the 6+ years that it's been growing it went from stage
  1 to stage 2 which gives my mom a slightly lower chance of beating it.
  But I have faith that she will! SURGERY IS 4/27. Putting together this fundraiser wasn't easy. I hate asking for money
  unless I'm working for it. But my mom and I are in a tough place right
  now and there's no way around it. My mom's going to need visiting
  nurses and professional aftercare for the first few weeks after
  surgery and she will need me to care for her for close to a month
  which means I'll be OUT OF WORK FOR A MONTH . This fundraiser is both to help cover my mom's expenses and also
  to help cover some of my own bills and travel expenses while I'm out
  of work so I can give 100% of my attention to my mom. There's
  no other option. I have no siblings and my dad passed away 10 years
  ago. So it's up to me...... and my mom is counting on me. I'm not looking to get fake boobs...or have a killer Birthday party
  on your dime. I just want to make sure I can take care of my
  mom....that I can focus ALL off my attention on her
  and not worry about having to pay for the visiting nurses and other
  expenses...or worry about my own bills. If you've ever had someone in your family who's had cancer, you
  know how much it turns your life and the life of everyone who loves
  that person upside down. CANCER JUST PLAIN SUCKS It
  already took my dad and I'm praying it doesn't take my mom. So PLEASE help by contributing, sharing and praying

  they’re trying to rest and sleep. I began sharing my “dream blessings” on my Facebook page a few years

  appreciated, the caring generosity of financial donations, small or
  big, right now can help an entire family make it through mama's
  illnesses and upcoming surgeries, every dime going to help with huge
  medical costs as well as keeping a roof and getting through daily life
  with minimum basics. Time is not our friend, as it is running out, so
  please act now to help and support. This fundraising campaign is for
  Sandy McClellan( me, hello <3 ), a mom of 6 amazing kids, 3 boys, 3
  girls, one (Ethan) of who is autistic and epileptic and often in the
  hospital as well and requires constant care by mama, and mama has
  several more surgeries and treatments in the upcoming months wearing
  her body down to nothing. Dealing for a long time with CHF, breast
  cancer, Hashimotos, severe spinal canal stenosis and 3 herniated
  discs, a full rotator cuff tear on the right shoulder requiring more
  surgery and more, more than any one person can handle alone, but to
  try to keep her family afloat...SHE NEEDS YOUR HELP TODAY, as things
  are worsening with her health, and she cannot keep up without
  everyone's help and having the human community rally around to.... not let illness destroy
  a life and a family. In 2012, she was dignosed with stage 3 invasive
  inductal carcinoma, HER2+, and has been fighting through chemotherapy,
  bilateral mastectomy, along with a shocking  amount of other ailments
  ( listed at the bottom) that have lead to complications, now having 8
  specialist doctors and is constantly at appointments, running tests,
  it's like Doc Offices and Hospitlals are her home. In 2007, she was
  dignosed with Congestive Heart Failure, enlarged heart and an ejection
  fraction of less than 10%, after 5 years of fighting to stay alive for
  her kids, she was then diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. During
  the last few years, she is also fighting severe Hashimoto's, an
  autoimmune thyriod disease, which leaves her even more ill and
  depleated. In Aug 2015 she was dignosed with such severe stenosis of
  the lower lumbar spine,crushed nerves and 3 broad based herniated
  discs, leaving the right leg nearly useless, she now must walk with a
  cane. She is facing several more surgeries, treatments, and testing.
  She is not able to function while under so many medications for a
  variety if illnesses, not able to walk or stand, digest food properly,
  constant debilitating exhaustion, and is in and out of the hospital.
  Her family relies on her to support them, and she is just not able to
  work full time, and benefits are few and far between. HEALTH INSURANCE
  has denied multiple procedures, leaving it up to her to pay out of
  pocket, literally taking the food off the table. SHE NEEDS YOUR HELP
  TODAY BY DONATING (every donation helps, no matter the size) so she
  can concentrate on getting well, as the constant stress is actually
  making her worse every day. PLEASE HELP TODAY and make a huge
  difference in a family's life, the kids need their mom around for a
  long time to come. Won't you please help support today by donating and
  spreading the word to friends and family. THANK YOU and together, this
  can have a happy ending.... Hi, I'm Sandy McClellan, and I cannot ever
  thank you all enough for all of the love and support through my fight,
  it ain't over yet, and your contributions will be a God Send to my
  family so I can get well. I am hoping to also try alternative
  therapies, like acupuncture, but my insurance does not pay for that
  either. It will help with the stress of illness as well as the daily
  stress of constant worry of losing everything due to not having the
  ability to work ( no income) until I'm well. I know people wonder
  about internet, I have to keep it on for my son Ethan who home schools
  and is disabled, so it's a big priority.THANK YOU FOR YOUR DONATIONS

  diagnosed with DIPG, an inoperable brain tumor. ""Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain
  tumor found in the pons, part of the brainstem on the lower back of
  the brain, near the top of the spinal cord. DIPG primarily affects
  children, with most diagnoses occurring between 5 and 7 years of age.
  DIPG makes up 10-15% of all brain tumors in children, with about
  100-150 new diagnoses per year in the United States and about 300 per
  year in all of North America and Europe. Unlike many other pediatric
  cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and
  cure rates for DIPG over the last few decades. Unfortunately, fewer

"Hi My name is Keli Tomlin and I qualified as a nurse 20 years ago,
  since 2000 I have been working at the Kent Oncology Centre in
  Maidstone and am now a Senior Nurse in Chemotherapy and I run the
  Charles Dickens Day Unit (CDDU) administering chemotherapy to patients
  from all over Kent, Medway and East Sussex. I applied last spring for a place in the London Marathon (not
  expecting to get a place as everyone knows, you never get in on your
  first attempt!) well on the 1st October 2015 this magazine appeared
  through the door confirming my place........! I have wanted to take part since the age of 11 so have waited 30
  years! I wanted to run (jog!) for a charity that had real meaning to
  me and one that I would be convinced that the funds raised would go
  directly to the patients, I have always had a keen interest in
  supporting yonger patients with cancer, since my sister was diagnosed
  with breast cancer at the age of 27 and she  had no-one of a similar
  age to talk to. With the help of one of my young patients Hayley Martin aged 31, we
  set up a support group for young adults with cancer, which meets once
  a month (on the 3rd wednesday of every month) the meetings are held on
  my unit, we called the group Freddies Friends, after Hayley's young
  son Freddie. Hayley was a prolific fundraiser who raised thousands of pounds for
  the unit, to recognise this, we named a room on the unit (that she had
  refurbished) after her. Hayley found having nice things to look forward to helped her to cope
  with the gruelling treatment and was keen for others to have access to
  the same things, she wanted to create 'magical memories' for patients,
  we formed a charity late last year and named it Hayley's Heroes. Incredibly sadly Hayley passed away on 16th Jan after a long battle
  with colon cancer, as a legacy to her, her family and friends are keen
  to continue to fund raise for our charity and we have lots planned for
  the coming year to help our patients. I will find it incredibly emotional on sunday 24th April, but will be
  running for all of the patients that I have looked after during the
  last 16 years, those that survived and those that haven't, the more we
  raise, the more we can help not only our patients, but their loved
  ones too, we musn't forget those as they need looking after too! Those of you who know me, know that I am not a runner, so this will
  be an incredible personal achievement for me, My two daughters are
  really excited and my wonderful hubby, has had them inorder for me to
  train, forgoing his weekend bike rides. Thank you for taking the time to read this and please sponser me,

"On September 1, 2010, Rich Parker and Nancy Pahl of Ocean Township,
  New Jersey, received news that no parent ever wants to hear. Their
  not-yet-four-year-old son, Logan, had been diagnosed with Acute
  Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). But the horror of that news did not stop
  there. At first it was believed that with several years of
  chemotherapy, Logan would be among the 80-90% of survivors of this
  disease and be cancer-free. He was placed in a “standard risk”
  category. However, in early October, they were struck with another
  blow. Tests had shown that Logan actually had a very rare type of
  ALL…hypodiploid ALL. In hypodiploid ALL, the individual does not have
  all the genetically-complete chromosomes necessary for humans. In this
  case, the survival rate is 40 – 50% and Logan has now been placed in a
  “very high risk category” and is currently undergoing a very
  aggressive chemotherapy treatment. Because of the rarity of his
  disease, his case was presented to the Leukemia Board at Children’s
  Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) who recommended a bone marrow
  transplant. Logan and his family have been tested to determine the
  possibility of a bone marrow match. He has a brother who ordinarily
  would be considered his best chance at a match (25%) but his brother
  is only a half-sibling, sharing only one parent’s DNA. It is felt
  unlikely that anyone in the family will be able to provide the perfect
  match that the doctors are seeking. Logan’s ethnicity – which plays a
  large part in one’s genetic make-up and, therefore, bone marrow type –
  includes Filipino, Chinese, Irish, German, Cuban, and a host of other
  nationalities that make the search for a match complex, if not
  impossible. The doctors will conduct a search of bone marrow donors
  worldwide in the hope of finding a match. In the meantime, in addition
  to the emotional and psychological toll this is taking on the family,
  there is also the financial burden. While, up to this point, insurance
  has covered a great deal of the medical expenses, the future is
  increasingly uncertain. Additionally, each time Logan is hospitalized
  both parents lose wages. Neither makes a lot of money to begin with
  and the loss of even one day’s pay creates worry and anxiety. With a
  bone marrow transplant looming, this will only get worse since once a
  donor is found, Logan will have to remain in the hospital for about 6
  weeks…in Philadelphia…and he will require extensive medical care after
  that. The Logan James Parker Fund was established to help the family
  with the financial issues that lay ahead. Friends have already begun
  organizing fundraisers, selling awareness bracelets and seeking
  outright donations. But, there is a long road to be traveled and so
  much more is needed. Any help that can be provided to this family will
  be more than welcomed and accepted with the deepest gratitude. Even
  the smallest contribution can make a difference. Thank you. (UPDATE
  12/1/10 - The transplant chief at CHOP has found a number of
  ""close matches"" that she is happy with. She has transplanted
  closes matches with success. However, she would like to do a stem cell
  transplant using cord blood and hopes to do so by late January or
  early February 2011. However, with the hospital being in Philadelphia
  and Logan having to spend 6 weeks there, it will mean a lot of
  sacrifices by the family. One, of course, will be the time away from
  Jordan. Additionally, in order to be with Nancy and Logan during this
  very critical time, Rich will have to take a significant amount of
  time off from work. With Nancy having to quit her job to care for
  Logan, this will reduce their income to nothing. For that reason, it
  is more important now than ever to raise funds for the family. )","7,175",of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/a4Acf,Love For Logan,74,,U.S. Dollar
"Hello all, I am starting this fund to he lp my brother purchase a van
  equipped for his special needs. Coach Rob, as his student athletes
  call him, requires one with a lift to transport his electric
  wheelchair and possibly with a restroom so he no longer has to rush to
  public restrooms while out and about. Robert Mendez has done so much in his 27 years of life. As a
  young man who was born with no limbs, he is in no way disabled. Robert
  works as a high school football coach and a motivational speaker. His job requires long days and many trips a day on public
  trasportation. While we are very thankful to have public
  transportation for Robert, it is quickly taking a toll on his body.
  Longer days are causing severe pressure sores and severe back pain due
  to his scoliosis. A trip to work that should take 30 minutes is taking
  2+ hours for him, and that is just one way. The longer days are
  requiring him to be in his wheelchair much longer, also making it
  difficult for restroom breaks. Already having to wait for his aid for
  assistance, he is constantly having to reglulate his liquid intake
  every day so he doesnt have to use the bathroom so often. Robert lives to inspire people young and old by teaching
  students that anything is possible. He also does motivational speaking
  about once a month and attends college 2 days a week. I have to give
  credit to his aid Ramona, she is a blessing. Please help Robert in

  ""bald kids"" which lead into kids with cancer and how
  treatment is very difficult, painful and often makes families sad for
  their little ones. We talked about how, during treatment, the medicine will often make
  their hair fall out, which makes them ""look bald"" as they
  said. I told them how people can donate their hair and make wigs for
  the kids to wear so they can have hair again. Both Braelle & Paige asked: ""Can we donate our hair to make

  child very happy with your beuatiful hair!"" Here we are about a

  was still not dead. Rather than remove her left eye which has lost

  cervical cancer at Bethel church California. I have not been able to work since the diagnosis, therefore I need
  help to get to bethel to recieve prayer. I  also want to attend the

"My name is Vlad and I suffer from epilepsy since
  1986 , when I was involved in a boating accident,
    which resulted in a trauma to the left frontal cranial lobe. The epilepsy is drug resistant and so far there has
  not been found a proper combination of drugs to stop the seizures, but
  only enough to reduce their number, which still is about 6-8/24 hours. An accurate and complete diagnosys can only be made in one of two
  ways: a functional MRI, which would be the easiest but it cannot
  be performed because I also have a Vagus Nerve Stimulator implant ( see
    video: VNS Implant ). Sadly all it can do is reduce the number of
  seizures from 12-15/day to 6-8/day, if at all. As the epilepsy is drug resistant, over the years I've used the
  following drugs, with no notable effect: Sodium Valproate (Depakine Chrono) 1000mg, Levetiracetam (Keppra) 1500mg, Lamotriginum (Plexxo) 200mg, Clobazam (Frisium) 20mg Lyrica (Pregabalin) 1800mg, Phenobarbital 50mg, Carbamazepine 1500mg, Diazepam 1200mg, Trileptal (Oxcarbazepine) 900mg, Rivotril (Clonazepanum) 500 mg. Currently I use 4 different drugs: Sodium Valproate (Depakine Chrono) 1000mg, Levetiracetam (Keppra) 1500mg, Lamotriginum (Plexxo) 200mg, Clobazam (Frisium) 20mg, and the VNS implant. This combination of treatments along with a specific
  diet keep the seisures between 6-8/24 hour cycle . With that in mind, I finally made the decision to undergo a surgery to remove the focal point of origin. The
  procedure involves two separated interventions: a deep scan with intracranian electrodes so I can
    precisely locate the focal point of origin. after that, the epilepsy surgery will remove it .
    Both interventions can be done with a budget of about 15,000 EUR",955,of €15k goal,https://fundrazr.com/eoPN7,Help end Vlad's 28 years of struggle with epilepsy,22,,Euro
"Since I haven't yet found a way to kick this habit, Type 1 Diabetes,
  I am unfortunately still reliant on a little pump filled with insulin
  to keep me alive. Just days before my recent accident, where I
  collided with an SUV while cycling to work, my trustee pump bit the
  dust. Talk about a double whammy. The not so fun part is that
  it costs $7000 for a new one! No joke. I'll get straight to the bits. The warranty is up, I am not covered
  by any benefit plan, and no, government health care does not help with
  these sorts of things. Thankfully I've been approved for financial
  assistance through the company, bringing the cost down to a modest
  $5000 ;) . That's awesome and significant, but I still need a lot of
  help to get me there. The pump is a pretty big expense for me as it is right now and since
  my accident on Feb 6th, I incurred some significant injuries and have
  not been able to go back to work. I am paying for injury therapy out
  of pocket and will say that I am struggling to make it as it is. Currently I am on a ""Loaner Pump"" from the company, since
  yes I wear it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. April 24th is the
  deadline before I either have to buy a new one or they take it back.
  Anything I can make by then, will be used for a down payment and
  anything that comes after will go towards monthly payments. The more I
  can put down, the more manageable my payment plan will be. So a BIG
  push now! Welcome to a bit of my world! I am so grateful for your support and contributions. A NOTE ABOUT PAYMENTS: Between Fundrazr and PayPal fees nearly
  10% of money raised goes into the ethers. Please consider an

  was struct down by the incurable illness that is multiple sclerosis
  also known as MS and since then it has changed my families life
  dramatically. Going from a full time personal trainer to being unable
  to walk to the shops and spending most my days housebound. The illness I have will get progressively worse over time and I can't
  simply live with this for much longer. The money that I am trying to
  raise is for stem cell treatment called HSCT which is not available on
  the NHS. The illness has had massive financial implications with my
  husband being the main source of income for my family so I cannot
  afford the cost of the treatment. The treatment involves taking my stem cells, freezing them then going
  through four days of chemo, then the doctors will re-inject the stem
  cells and my body would be in simple terms, rebooted and MS free. With
  85% success rate I am very eager to go ahead with this although it is
  very harsh and expensive treatment. This is where I need your help!

"Perspective. When my sister, Andrea Temarantz, was pregnant with my nephew, Ryder,
  he was diagnosed with Down Syndrome. That news was so scary for
  everyone to hear. We never want anything ""bad"" for our kids
  but my sister & brother-in-law, Joey Temarantz, were amazing about
  it. They accepted it & educated themselves along with the rest of
  their family members. When Ryder was born we were all prepared for all
  sorts of health issues to arise. Amazingly, not one health issue, that
  has to do with Down Syndrome, has materialized. Ryder has met every
  ""normal"" marker & measurement for a ""typical""
  4 month old baby. Such ""normalcy"" for his first 4 months is
  probably why what has gone on over the last 5 days has been so
    shocking. Awareness. About 2 years ago Andrea happened to see a post on Facebook with a
  young girl whose eye was glowing. She said she remembered that this
  was a sign of something being wrong but truly didn't pay too much
  attention. Over the last 4 months she has taken a TON of photos of her
  new baby boy, Ryder. Recently she noticed that his left eye seemed to
  have a strange ""glow"" in many of the pictures. By the grace of God Andrea happened to mention this at Ryder's 4
  month checkup on Tuesday, January 5th. 24 hours later they were told
  that Ryder has cancer in his left eye. Retinoblastoma. On Thursday, January 7th, Joey & Andrea checked Ryder in to the
  Phoenix Children's Hospital for an MRI & a more in depth look into
  Ryder's eyes. Praise God that this cancer had NOT yet spread to his
  brain or to his other eye. Choices. Joey & Andrea were given options for treatment: 1. remove the eye 2. get a port inserted in their 4 month old son & start chemotherapy. Yuck to both of those options. Kids with Down Syndrome already have an increased chance of
  developing leukemia. 6 rounds of chemo would sharply increase that
  risk of Ryder developing a secondary cancer. Removing the eye seemed
  to be the way to go. Then they met with the oncologist. He said that
  this type of retinoblastoma MIGHT be the kind that will ultimately
  attack both eyes. This information was a game changer. Now, if we
  could salvage some vision in this eye it would be better for him in
  the long run. Obviously the best thing to do would be to find out exactly WHICH
  type of retinoblastoma he has and then decide on a course of
  treatment! Sounds logical doesn't it?!? Nothing can just be simple when your kid has cancer. The genetic testing to determine which type of retinoblastoma Ryder
  has won't be back for 6 weeks. Their choice of treatment for Ryder has
  to be determined this week because these tumors can grow quickly. So
  frustrating but this is the situation we have before us. Ugh. One of the doctors at Phoenix Children's Hospital mentioned that a
  hospital in New York does a unique chemotherapy delivery method for
  this exact type of tumor. If Joey & Andrea could make a decision
  that could save Ryder's eye and NOT push chemo poisons throughout his
  4 month old body that would be PERFECT. Treatment. The Temarantz family found out today that Ryder has been approved by
  the physician in New York & is officially a candidate for this
    treatment! Ryder is taking his mom to New York City! They are leaving tomorrow
  & going on the ultimate roadtrip! Blessings. They are so very blessed to have found this cancer early. They are so very blessed to have this opportunity to treat it without
  endangering his already compromised immune system further. They are so very blessed with an amazing support system of family
  & friends. They are so very blessed to have each other & to have the
  opportunity to raise their sons, Joe & Ryder. They would be so very blessed if we could all help them out as they
  face, not only the stress of the situation, but the suffocating costs
  of everything that will be involved in this journey. Please #PrayForRyder as he begins his battle against retinoblastoma. On behalf of my baby sister, Andrea, her amazing husband, Joey, and
  two of my beautiful nephews in Arizona, Joe & Ryder, thank you. Jane Dufoe","16,235",of $30k goal,https://fundrazr.com/a15gX5,Ryder's Retinoblastoma Battle #PrayForRyder,313,,U.S. Dollar

"There’s nothing typical or graceful about reaching out to so many
  people in such an intimate way, but with such seemingly indelicate
  intent, especially considering that you probably haven't seen Rose in
  a while: no matter if you’re a friend, family member, or our neighbor
  in the apartment downstairs. We haven’t been getting out much (but
  rest assured we still think of you fondly and often). We’ve simply
  reached a point where there is more at stake than our social lives. In a nutshell? Rose is in pain. She is in pain every day, and she is
  in pain all day; she’s actually in so much pain, that
  it was recently diagnosed: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome
  (CRPS) . CRPS is incurable, but in most cases can be managed, made
  livable. The key is identifying and treating as many of the
  individually diagnosable components of the pain as possible,
  effectively calming the sympathetic nervous system and thus its
  learned tendency to be hyper-reactive. At the core of Rose’s CRPS is a severe case of Temporomandibular Joint Disorder
  (TMJD) . Despite six years of treatment in the U.K. and access to
  specialized healthcare in the U.S. over the past four years, her
  condition has continued to worsen, and more rapidly than ever over the
  past year. The fat grafts that were injected into her jaw joints last
  summer as part of a discectomy procedure have
  dissolved, and there are fragments of cartilage still lodged deep in
  the joints; they're now bone-on-bone, with no padding to prevent the
  mandible from grinding in its socket. The bones are eroding, and the
  effects of their malfunction are radiating throughout Rose's body.
  What little energy she has gets channeled to enduring the effects of synovitis , fibromyalgia , sciatica , and migraines. Traditional approaches to
  pain management have not been able to keep up; and, as of earlier this
  week, her left TMJ is locked closed. Leveling out and reducing Rose’s pain will require a number of things. She needs a stint of cervical spine chiropractic treatment to
  address an acute rotation of her first vertebra. Its misalignment
  generates strain in the muscles of her upper body and is responsible
  for a sizable portion of her headache (we quit using the plural long
  ago; now there is just the one, unending ‘ache’). It also wreaks havoc
  on the sympathetic nerves that run along the spine. In terms of immediate relief, Rose will benefit from ketamine
  therapy, either in a clinic or home-based palliative care setting. The
  deterioration of her condition and increase in pain have been
  intensified over time by higher and higher doses of opioid
  painkillers, and ketamine is an alternative favored by physicians
  faced with opioid-immune, chronic pain patients. It's classified as an
  'experimental treatment', though, and so will not be covered by insurance. As a sort of maintenance measure, Rose will need to see an
  'ortho-dentist' specializing in TMJD treatment, to manage a bite
  splint. She committed to this course of treatment in January of 2016
  only to be told a few weeks later that her jaw is “floating” in
  decaying joint space, and so cannot be stabilized with a splint. Her
  dentist has since been supportive and encouraging; she has not,
  however, offered to refund our money or annul our obligation to
  continue payments. Our desperation to pursue this treatment track
  turns out to have been misguided—as has our understanding of our
  insurance provider’s willingness to help with the cost. All of these measures are really just stopgaps to help Rose
  prepare for (and battle for 60% insurance contribution toward) a TMJ
  arthroplasty that differs significantly from any procedure she has had
  thus far. Essentially, Rose's second chance at life will be defined by the
  outcome, so we’re fortunate that the world’s foremost expert, whose
  work is renowned for turning patients’ lives around for the better,
  practices out of Saint Petersburg, Florida (only an eight-hour drive
  away from her life in Atlanta, Georgia). THE ‘WHY’: Most of you knew Rose before her daily life was defined by bed
  rest, pain medication, doctor’s appointments, and a diet of baby food.
  You wouldn’t recognize the girl who has exhausted the maximum duration
  of Medical Leave allowed by her PhD program. Her studies have
  gradually become replaced by aspirations like being able to move all
  the joints required to get out of bed (which is most of them!) and
  climbing the stairs to our apartment. Leaving the house for any reason
  has become a frightening prospect, and the rare occasions that it
  happens require multiple days of recuperation. The idea of crowdfunding a person's health is hard to
  comprehend...especially when that person is your soulmate. No
  conversion rate can establish the dollar amount of how valuable a life
  is. Four years ago, Rose and I met in graduate school and found one
  another to be the most beautiful of human beings. We married in May of
  2015, and the rest is history...but it’s a history that we have to
  fight to extend. Rose is wilting, and her physical state—pain aside—will only
  deteriorate. As odd and alarming as it is to say of a woman in her
  twenties: we have to take these strides while her body is still salvageable. Please consider helping to make this possible. The financial
  demand is intimidating, but our only option is to hope its not
  impossible. Treatments for this condition are very alien to the NHS in
  England, and all other, more fiscal and conservative approaches have
  been exhausted. Any contribution would be
  appreciated, even if it just means taking a few minutes to share our
  campaign in a post or an email. Thank you all so, so much.",500,of $45k goal,https://fundrazr.com/118TH9,TMJD Surgery for our Rose,1,,U.S. Dollar

"Hello, my name is MaryAnne I live in a small town in Muskoka,
  Ontario, Canada. We are asking for your support to help us build a home. Disaster struck us in 2009 just as we were preparing to build
    on land that has gifted to us by my Mom so that we could live close
    to her. She just found out she had cancer (lung) so we were
  all preparing for that long journey together and of course she had to
  stop smoking before they removed a small tumor from her lung. She did
  it, I was amazed and incredibly releived. I had hurt my back  several months prior and was hoping that by the
  time her surgery was booked for  Novemeber, it would have healed on
  it's own like most herniated disc's do. I did all the right things and
  spent a great deal of money on treatments not covered by OHIP. But it
  wasn't healing like it usually did and the pain meds didn't seem to
  work for this. So I went for an MRI and it ended up being a rather
  large herniated disc at L4/L5 right side. I was so annoyed with
  myself, just didn't need to deal with that right now, I needed to look
  after my Mom. I was sent to a Vascular Neurosurgeon and when he told us
    that it was basically an easy fix, ""I do hundreds of these a
  year"", it's just day surgery and you'll walk out the
  same day with no pain. The most you'll feel may be numbness and/or
  tingling but it'll disapate. I was ecstatic, but my Mom ,she was much more hestitant
  about me going in for that surgery But I just figured that was Mom
  being a Mom. We should all listen to our Mommy's. She was right. October
    21, the day my Mom through away any chance of survivng lung cancer.
    Months of not smoking, 1 phone call later that night destroyed my
    entire Family. I remember laying in the hospital bed in ICU while a maching
    was breathing for me, I could hear everyone talking but nobody knew
    that. I was crying because I had no idea how my Mom was. I heard
    them telling my Husband that I was going to die (AGAIN), I
  wasn't upset about dying, I was upset because I wasn't going to get a
  chance to talk to my Children, my Sisters, Brother and worse my Mom. I knew this would be devistating for her because I lost my infant
  son, ALexander, just six months after my Daddy died in 1990 of stomach
  cancer. It's a differnet ""ball game"" sort of speak when you
  lose a Child, a whole that never fills back up or heals. My Mom died about 6 months after that day I only got to see her a few
  times, as I was in Hospital a few hours away and it was hard for both
  of us. I was on oxygen (never smoked in my life), and my life still
  ,""hanging in the balance"". As for my Sister's and Brother,
  well 2 SIster's still talk to me the others blame me for Her early
  death but so do I. Try to live with that. My 1 Sister told me, I
  killed our Mother. I didn't do anything wrong except trust someone I knew I
    shouldn't have. I tell everyone, ""listen to your
  gut"". I don't know what that ""gut feeling"" is
  or where it comes from but it was spot on this day. The Dr. accidently
  severed 2 ilac arteries, (nearly 75%) on the opposite side of the
  injury. I woke during the surgery to hear alot of commotion but when I
  woke at 09:00 am the pain was ,""out of this world sharp stabbing
  and intense"". But they just kept giving me medication and r efused to call
    my Husband, even after I CODE BLUE at 12:30. He was due to
  pick me up with our adopted Daughter (5) at 4:30pm. They called Him at
  4:20 to tell Him to get here, there's a problem. He was in the parking
  lot by than. As they walked Him and our Daughter down the Hospital coridor
    they told him I died, waited a few seconds to finish, Oh
  but we got her back and she's stabble for now but is not going to make
  it, go see Her. Can you imagine the shock? So now we're left to pick up the pieces and it is not fun or easy. I
  am grateful to be alive, a bit perplexed as to how and why but
  grateful my adopted Daughter's last moment with me wasn't the,
    moment our eyes met in the Hospital just before I went. So if you could open your hearts to help us I would
  be eternally grateful. We're not just looking for cash
    donations we'd be happy to have your Expertise, time  and/or equipment. Example: Carpenters, plumbing, electricla etc. We've had a few
  wonderful people offer their experise and helping hand already. If you can lend a hand, PLEASE l et us know, you can

"My Story My name is Anita Shaffer and I have Hereditary Angio Edema, Type 1. I
  was officially diagnosed at the age of 6 years old in 1977 by a doctor
  at the University of Michigan after many ER visits with severe
  abdominal and facial swelling. I spent the first 35 years of my life seeing specialists, trying new
  drug therapies (with terrible side effects) and getting life saving
  intervention at my local emergency room as many as 2 times per month. About 8 years ago, with the help of HAEA, I was able to find a new
  research study very near my home. After 3 years, this particular drug
  therapy was FDA approved and everything opened up to me. I was
  introduced to a non profit that has been able to help me keep access
  to my rescue medication by helping me find the right insurance and
  financially assist me with cost of my copay and deductibles. Since
  this time, several rescue therapies have been introduced and made
  available to people with this disease. 2015 was the first year I didn't have to visit the emergency room.
  Not once!! I have lived with this disease my whole life and in many ways it has
  shaped my life and made me the person I am. I am very grateful to be
  here and so happy to have made it to a time where there are finally so
  many options to treat people, like myself, who live with HAE.
  Physician and general awareness is also so important and is improving everyday. My next step is to give back and raise even more awareness. I hope
  you will join me in helping if you can. http://www.haabsrestaurant.com Where will the money go? Proceeds go to the US Hereditary Angioedema Association. “The HAEA is

  They are committed to advancing and conducting clinical research
  designed to improve the lives of HAE patients and ultimately a cure.” https://www.haea.org/ What is HAE? Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a rare, debilitating and potentially
  fatal genetic disease resulting from a deficiency of a key plasma
  protein. Patients suffer from unpredictable attacks of swelling that
  involves the hands, feet, abdomen, face, and airway. Abdominal
  swelling involves excruciating pain and vomiting that can last up to
  72 hours. Airway attacks constitute a major medical emergency that can
  lead to death by suffocation. Despite the availability of new
  medicines and progress made in HAE advocacy and education, preventable
  HAE-related deaths continue to occur, and many patients still suffer
  from disabling attacks. To find out more, check out www.haea.org",360,of $200 goal,https://fundrazr.com/haediningforacause,HAE- Dining for a Cause,13,,U.S. Dollar
"Thank you for taking the time to
    read this. My name is Zahrah Sita, and I
    have had a passion for natural healing for many years. I became
    passionate about natural health when my own health severely failed
    me in my early 20's. After many doctors visits, therapies and
    medications that did not work - I embarked on a journey of
    self-education and self-healing to restore my health. Initially, I
    was healing severe systemic candida, and a wide range of allergies
    and chemical sensitivities that severely impaired and limited my
    daily life. In this process I was inspired to attend school for
    Traditional Chinese Medicine and Oriental Bodywork Therapies. Over
    the years my quest for learning led me to become trained in
    herbology from many different systems, organ cleansing, fasting,
    dietary therapies, acupuncture, and more. With all this knowledge I was able to create a personal
      healing strategy that was a huge success - this strategy and
      health plan helped me heal advanced stage cancer in less than 6
      months! I have helped many others regain health through healing
      programs and wellness guidance - including others who have healed
      cancer naturally. I am sharing my knowledge and
    experiences, as well as collaborating with other natural healers and
    educators to help people find true health and vitality. The plan now is to launch the
    healing center.  This is a safe place for people to receive
    consultations, health guidance, bodywork services, acupuncture,
    natural medicines, and more. There will also be classes - helping
    empower people with knowledge and education about how to live a
    healthy life and keep their bodies, minds, hearts, and spirits in
    alignment. I have seen that when a person has the opportunity to
    heal their body, that they have the ability to gain personal
    empowermemt and align with their purpose! This healing space will be available for all - including
      those who do not have the means to afford natural health services!
      We will provide sliding scale fees, trade opportunities, as well
      as scholarships to individuals and families in need. ***We have the space - we just need to do some slight
        improvements, build a website, gather some supplies, and do some
        savvy marketing! This is where your help comes in.
    Please help support this effort. We will be providing help to many
    others if we can reach our goal. Your contribution will keep
      giving - and will make our world a little bit brighter and a
      little bit healthier! Please go ahead and share whatever funding you can, and we
    also ask that you share this campaign by posting to your social
    media outlets, sharing with friends, etc. Be part of this movement
    that is designed to assist others in becoming healthy, empowered,
    and inspired! Thank you again for taking the time to read this. Thank you
      immensly to those who have taken the time to assist! Every little
      or big contribution gets us closer to our goal... of sharing

  after an x-ray taken several years ago but it was not confirmed until
  this past January. Her mother was destroyed with radiation and died a
  horrible death. Her father took his life because he didn't want to
  follow the same path the ""modern"" medical profession uses to
  ""treat"" cancer. So here I am asking for help to save her life. We tried all the alternative protocals offered on the website cancertutor.com She just kept getting worse. My Dear was resigned to stay home
  and keep the family ""together"". When I heard her talking I
  would say ""yes"". She would say, ""I'm just talking to
  God"". I don't have good hearing. She talks to Him all the time.
  Lately, it's got to where she prays for Him to take her home. And I
  say, ""Dear, you are home, I'm right here"". Most of this
  happens when she sleeps. The reason she did not even think of going to a clinic was
  money. My Bible says the worth of a soul is all the money in the world. Traditional cancer treatments of cut, burn and poison kill 98%
  of all cancer patients in 5 years according to the American Medical Association. I got an email from Ty Bollinger about his 9 part documentary on
  ""The Truth About Cancer: A Global Quest"". When I signed up
  and got the link for the event, there was an article about PNC27. I
  did a search. There are 4 medical reports published proving PNC27 only
  kills cancer cells and nothing else 100% of the time without side
  effects. But the clincher was Ty sent me a two page report saying
  ""this cures cancer"". He lost seven of his loved ones. I'm sold. Next, I have to get my Dear to the Hope4Cancer Clinic in
  Tijuana, Mexico. After she and I knew this is the place. She said,
  ""Where's the money coming from? We don't have it. Even if we did,
  I don't want to leave home."" On Thursday of last week, I got a

  cancer. He went through multiple rounds of chemotherapy before
  discovering the cancer had spread to his lungs. As the disease

  and their families have been by her side the entire journey,
  supporting and loving her. Let's demonstrate our love for them with a
  financial gift-- any amount is a blessing! As any major illness is prone to do, beating cancer has become a full

  more as she fights to heal. There is such an added expense when
  everyone is spending so much time in hospitals and doctors offices. It

  by giving them a financial safety net to offset those costs. The Pulises have kept a blog with some information about the
  diagnosis and the steps towards healing. You can find it online

"Hello family, friends, and supporters!  I am a 33-year old survivor
  of an extremely rare bone tumor (desmoplastic fibroma), and have
  decided to embark on a journey to create more awareness and provide
  funding for more research for these rare tumors to help physicians and
  patients better understand these conditions, procedures, and treatment/recovery. I am currently recovering after undergoing a more aggressive/radical
  treatment after a 2nd recurrence of this tumor (in my right femur, as
  pictured) to replace my knee as well as half of the femur - the
  typical treatment for malignant osteasarcoma (my 5th operation in
  total).  This is pretty much a testament to how aggressive and
  grueling these tumors are, whether they are benign or not - that the
  treatment is similar or can be identical to that of a cancerous growth
  of the bone. These tumors happen in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life; therefore,
  the majority of individuals enduring this pain, multiple operations,
  and lengthy recoveries are in their childhood, teens, 20's and 30's.
   These are ages that are supposed to be the most active, fun, and
  joyful for youngsters and able-bodied people to be exercising, playing
  sports, etc.  Surgeries can be extremely invasive, painful, and
  continual. My goal is to create more awareness of these tumors that are vary
  rare (they make up approximately 2% of all tumors) and there are only
  about 120-200 orthopedic oncologists in the United States able to
  treat these rare growths.  Not to mention, in major cities and
  teaching institutions, rather than equally spread throughout - making
  it difficult for some patients to travel to see exactly who they need
  to see. I'd like to be able to create a community where survivors of
  these tumors can share their experiences with one another and provide
  support, as well as to start a fund that will benefit research toward
  a particular body of medical science that will be dedicated to
  learning more about muskuloskeletal lesions/tumors. For more information about bone tumors, please visit www.bonetumor.org . EVERY dollar counts.  Many
  perks are available to select with a donation. PLEASE like us on Facebook, www.facebook.com/bonetumorawareness, and/or

  This causes the Aorta to work extra hard to pump blood out to the
  body. In her 24 young years her Aorta has been pushed to the limit, it
  is now 5 cm diameter compared to a normal size of 2.2-2.5 cm and it is
  so stenotic (tight) that the inside is essentially a pin hole. She will be undergoing open heart surgery within a couple days to
  replace the Aorta as well as the Aortic Valve connecting it to the
  heart. Luckily she is young and will hopefully be okay healing from
  what they call the 'Ross Procedure'. Essentially switching one Artery
  for another and replacing the valve. Doctors believe this is the best option however it takes her from a
  single heart disease to double heart disease patient once another
  artery is affected. Dental work is also required before surgery to prevent infection from
  spreading to her heart after surgergy and as she just turned 24 she is
  no longer covered by insurance. Once the operation is finished, doctors say the recovery period is
  about 6 months and the medication needed to help this process is not
  all covered by OHIP. Gina is in good spirits and hoping to be healthy again soon! Any contributions would be very much appreciated. There are costs she
  was not prepared for and any contributions would really help during
  this difficult time.","4,185",of $3.5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/c183Zb,Please help Gina through her heart surgery,46,,Canadian Dollar

"Hi my name is Anita Wilkey. I am the proud mother of two teenage high school boys. i have been
    raising them by myself almost since birth. I am proud of them both,
    they have their own very different personalities but share the same
    deep rooted ethics. David is a big loving teddy bear that still
  requires as many hugs as he can get from me everyday. When David was
  born he was very blue and not breathing on his own. He had to have an
  adrinline shot to get him to respond. I wasn't able to see him for
  awhile after he born. He is almost 18 now and is slightly slower to
  grasp learning new things. He wants to go to tech school after high
  school to learn either wielding or landscaping. Joseph is loving in his own way. He doesn't
    require the open affection that David does. When Joseph was born,
    about 3 weeks old, he was hospitalized for spinal meningitus. He was
    later diagnosed with ALL LEUKIMA a month before his 3rd birthday in
    2002. He went through 5 1/2 years of chemotherapy and had radiation
    to his brain. The radiation has stunted his growth some. Joseph is an honors student at Lebanon High
    School. He is in honors history and science. he plans on going into
    the medical field after high school, nuclear medicine. With all of
    the time that he has spent in the hospital he grew to love medicine
    and cooking. I had to rent a car on May 5th to take Joseph to St. Louis to
    have 9 teeth removed, that is a 2 1/2 hour drive from where we live.
    I couldn't get him into a dentist that would work on him where we
    live because of his medical history. All of the chemo and other
    medicines he has been on in the past have really took their toll on
    his oral health. I can't afford to rent a car for all of the appointments
      required to get Joseph's mouth back in shape. It costs me a $200
      deposit and $67 a day for a car rental. That is to much for me to handle. Joseph is required to go to St. Jude's in Springfield MO
    for regular check-up's for his Leukemia and the possibility of other
    cancers forming from the years of chemo and radiation. At this time
    he is due for another check-up. All funds raised will go to the purchase of a good, reliable
      car and registration, insurance, taxes etc..... Any leftover funds
      will be put into a savings account for college for both David and Joseph. Thank you for reading OUR story. If you can't donate PLEASE

"Dearest friends and family, As many of you know, Alex has been diagnosed with a rare and
  aggressive form of Leukemia Lymphoma.  Since his diagnoses in
  September, he has been using conventional and complementary medicine
  to battle his cancer.  Currently, he is receiving chemotherapy while
  waiting for a viable match for a stem cell transplant.  I have known
  Alex for over 20 years, and not once has he ever shied away from
  helping me or anyone else during times of need .  I have created this
  page in hopes to return the favour. The challenge is that not all of
  the medicine/treatments are covered by our government's medical plan. 
  And since Alex was self employed, he does not receive Employment
  Insurance benefits during the times he is not working.  To make
  matters worse, the chemotherapy has significantly weakened his immune
  system, preventing him from having prolonged human contact, thus
  making him unable to work.  So far, he has been able to cover most of
  the cost but is reaching a point where he needs your help to continue. The money raised will help cover the following treatment(s): -Neupogen shots - 15-20 shots per month.  $20/shot. $300-$400/month -Monthly medicine/herbal supplements: $726 -Visit to a Clinic in Japan - Once Alex has successfully received his
  bone marrow transplant and is strong enough to travel, he plans on
  visiting treatment centers in Japan, where they have vast experience
  with recovery from this type of rare cancer. This is most likely going
  to be in the new year.  The cost for the full treatment is
  approximately $600-$1000/day for around 5-7 weeks. In addition to monetary donations, I encourage all of you to donate
  your blood or stem cells if you can. Your donation can help save lives
  like Alex’s. You can find more information and book an appointment at https://www.blood.ca/en . Alex is one of the most generous and caring people I know. In all the
  years I have known him, Alex has always been the type of person to
  help his friends and family in any way that he can, even when they
  don't ask . Conversely, he's not the type of person to easily accept
  help, even when there's an entire community waiting to do so. So here
  is our chance. Here is our chance to show our appreciation and
  gratitude towards such a caring individual. Lastly, I want to thank you all for taking the time to read this and
  please donate. It takes a community of support and help to make things
  possible. Every bit counts!! Sincerely, Allan","24,193",of $35k goal,https://fundrazr.com/c13wKc,Please help Alex on his battle against cancer.,174,,Canadian Dollar
"On May 16, 2016 Gary Smart called an Ambulance from a rest area east
  of the Bay Bridge in Price Maryland. he was transported to Chester
  River Hospital in Maryland. initially his care plan was IVF's and IV
  atbx and an overnight stay for observation. His wife Clare was in
  Jacksonville for orientation when she got the call that his condition
  had started to decline. Clare, his son Josh and daughter Jennifer flew
  into Maryland that afternoon. Josh and Clare arrived first and went to
  Chster River hospital where he was placed in the ICU. We were informed
  that he needed a higher level of care and needed to be airlifted to a
  local hospital in Baltimore. He was transported that night to the
  University of Mayland Medical Center. When we arrived to the University of Maryland Medical Center the
  doctor came out to the waiting room as soon as they landed with my
  father. they told us he was very sick and he had about a 50/50 chance
  of survival at this time. He explained that my father was septic and
  needed to be placed on ECMO. Since the night of his admission he has
  steadily been showing signs of improvement but we understand he is
  very sick. We have been prepared for this to be a long recovery. The
  doctors have told us weeks- months and then therapy. My father is on a
  ventilator so he will have to wean from that before he can come home.
  My family would love it if you could continue to pray about that
  please . My family will need to provide food and shelter and money to live on
  during my fathers recovery until my parents can get back on their feet
  again. This has caused such a huge financial burden in an already

"Katy Juliet is the beautiful angel born to Mathew and Krista Plumeri
  just 10 months ago. On May 17, 2016, Krista and Matthew received the news every loving
  parent considers their worst nightmare, ""Your baby has cancer."" Katy has been diagnosed with a very rare form of Leukemia, Acute
  Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). The term ""acute"" refers to the
  tendency of this disease to progress rapidly. The survivability of
  this type of leukemia in infants is less than 50%, therefore it is
  imperative that aggressive treatment begin immediately. For the past several days Katy's little body has endured blood tests,
  bone marrow tests, a lumbar puncture, and numerous other invasive
  diagnostic testing methods. Her mommy and daddy have not left her side. Katy's battle has just begun. The treatment phases for this type of
  cancer are long. She is facing months of chemotherapy, first to kill
  as many leukemia cells as possible, then consolidation chemotherapy to
  stop the spread of the cancer, and then intensification therapy to
  kill off any remaining cancer cells. She is likely to also need a bone
  marrow transplant. This entire process could initially take
  approximately 9 months. As you can imagine Matthew and Krista are completely devastated. This
  family knows their faith in God is their most powerful source of
  healing for Katy and ridding this cancer from her little body. We are organizing this fundraiser to help Matthew and Krista focus on
  what really matters, ensuring Katy has every possible advantage as she
  prepares for the fight of her life. The financial strain on this young
  family will be tremendous. Katy will not be able to leave the hospital
  for months, and the Jacobsen's ability to pay for living expenses and
  related costs will be severely impacted due to their loss of income
  while caring for their only child around the clock at the hospital.
  Our goal is to relieve this enormous financial burden and make it
  possible for Matthew and Krista to spend every moment with their baby
  girl during the most difficult time of their lives. We, Katy's family, are asking you for your love, support and fervent
  prayers for the Jacobsens along with any financial donation you are

"Hey Guys... My name is Michael ""BLUE"" Smith. I'm an
    artist from Austin, TX. I have a degenerative eye disease called
    Keratoconus. Both of my eyes are in danger. My left cornea sticks
    out like a football and has gotten worse over the last few years,
    and will continue to progress until I get a cornea transplant. Because of the way my cornea is shaped, I am unable to wear a
    corrective lense. My right eye is not as bad YET so i am able to
    wear a special contact lense, that helps me to see clearly... at
    least through one eye. So eveybody who has told me I have a good eye
    for photography had no clue of what truth they were actually saying ...lol.. (a little humor). But on a serious note... I have no clue of when I will be able
    to afford the cost of the corneal transplant for my left eye and the
    disease has been progressing in both eyes. However, in the mean
    time, I have decided to go ahead and have a less invasive surgery on
    my right eye to prevent having to get a corneal transplant as I
    can't avoid for my left eye. The surgery is known as corneal collagen crosslinking. LOOK AT HOW IT'S DONE . The procedure involves applying liquid riboflavin (vitamin B2)
    to the surface of the eye, followed by treatment with a controlled
    application of ultraviolet light , to eliminate corneal ectasia . Not being able to see sometimes initiates anxiety and also makes
    it more difficult to get ready in the morning and be productive in
    all aspects of my life.. not just photography. I'm a husband. In fact 3 years ago I did a campaign like this for my wife Ashleigh
  who had stage 3 breast cancer at the age of 28. That campaign was very
  successful and she is doing much better now. I am a father. Of two. My kids are 5 and 6 years old and I still have so much
    more to do with them. I want to be able to se there artwork from
    school, help them with their homework, and watch movies with them. I'm a friend. I have supported and helped spearhead some of the most dynamic
    events and movements in my city. From ministry, to outreach, to
    mentorship, and education. My art is for everyone. Whether it be
    music, photography, or just the portrait of victories in my my life. My surgery is scheduled for June 22nd and I need your help. Its
    going to cost me $2500 out of pocket and Im not sure if I can come
    up with that by the day of operation. I've already applied for care

"Our friend Keith Rickert is currently on a wait list for a heart
  transplant as a result of a his genetic heart disease Arrhythmogenic
  Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a form of heart disease that
  usually appears in adulthood and causes part of the myocardium (heart
  muscle wall) to break down over time, increasing the risk of an
  abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) and risk of sudden death, especially
  during any strenuous exercise. Keith's condition first presented
  itself suddenly 6 years ago while playing ball hockey where he
  suffered a near death experience and barely survived to tell the tale. In 2007, Keith required emergency open heart surgery and
  installation of a defibrillator, and a 6 week hospital recovery to get
  back on his feet again. All this happening at a time when he was just
  finishing his Petroleum Technology program and preparing to start an
  exciting career in the NL Oil & Gas Industry, which became a
  struggle due to his condition and inability to work in an offshore
  environment. Today, Keith is employed by East Coast Tubular Ltd. as an
  onshore Materials Co-ordinator. Keith and his lovely wife Kerri - who has been his rock through
  all the struggles over the past several years - were married this past
  June in Cuba. The couple have beautiful energetic two year old
  daughter, Lailah. Over the course of the past 6 years since his diagnosis Keith
  has been leading a very restrictive lifestyle for a 34 year old guy,
  and in recent months his condition has been deteriorating. Sadly just
  1 week following their wedding Keith and Kerri received the shocking
  news that Keith’s heart was functioning below 20% indicating early
  stage heart failure and the only course of treatment now is a Heart
  Transplant. Keith has been in and out of hospital recently with
  complications of ARVC, and is expected to re-locate to Ottawa to
  undergo extensive pre-transplant testing and wait for a compatible new
  heart to come available. As you can imagine this is a very difficult and emotional time
  for this young family and they need our help and support to take on
  this long journey ahead. With the cost of flights, temporary
  accommodation, rentals , etc., not to mention the disruption to their
  income due to leave of absence from work for both Keith and Kerri, and
  the juggling of child care for their young daughter. They could be
  waiting for a suitable heart for a considerable period of time and
  then post transplant recovery afterwards. Let's all come out and open our hearts (and wallets) and show
  Keith and his family that we are all behind them as they face this
  difficult journey, and wish Keith the best for a short wait and swift

"I am Jennifer,  Senna's cousin and I'm starting this
          fundrasing so we can support Anna with medications and
          treatments that Senna needs due his brain tumour. It's
          not easy to devote 10 years of your life, fighting to save
          your son's life without much of support and being a single
          mom. Lets please help Senna, he needs us! Your
          support is very much appreciated. Senna was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor called
              crainyofaringoma at the age of 2. The doctors at SickKids
              Hospital surgically implanted an omya reservoir into the
              tumor and tried to drain it at the same time they injected
              the tumor with blyomisen a chemocoktail. It was
              unsuccessful. At the age of 5 the tumor continued to grow
              and damage the optic nerve leaving Senna blind in the left
              eye and very little vision in the right…his entire
              endocrine system is compromised and he has several
              medications that he takes for life. The neurosurgeons
              decided it would be best for him to have craniotomy, a
              very invasive 9 hour open brain procedure with no
              guarantees…this was very successful. After 5 years of
              recovery Senna experienced a lot of pain and suffered with
              viruses and illness…in 2010 the tumor once again began to
              grow the doctors were a little unsure as to what they
              could do as operating was not an option and chemotherapy
              proved unsuccessful so they approached it with
              radiation…in 2013 Senna began a 6 week radiation treatment
              and since we had to go every day he missed school . this
              treatment was successful and the results were positive
              however the radiation changed Senna. He was very fatigued
              and sad most of the time….His journey was not over as in
              November 2015 MRI showed that the tumor once again started
              to grow this time it was heading in the direction of the
              optic nerve in the right eye….again the doctors wanted to
              observe him and in January 2016 Senna almost lost the
              battle when he was rushed to sick kids emergency as he was
              in septic shock and his immune system was shutting down.
              After several months the doctors agreed that a second
              batch of radiation is the best way to aggressively stop
              this growth in its tracks…On May 24th 2016 Senna started
              radiation and he will continue for the next six weeks….. This has left me unable to work for the past 10 years
              as his full time caregiver…senna wont be finishing grade 9
              and will have to mist likely pick up next year…thank you. Regards, Anna Prezio 416 841 9493 prezioanna@gmail.com","3,560",of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/918Oza,Fighting for Senna's health,23,,Canadian Dollar

  the prayers from family & friends & the work of the Vancouver
  Children's Hospital for saving my daughter's life. My daughter has regular check ups with Edocrine specalists at

"On December 10th, 2013, I was diagnosed with lyme disease. I had odd
  rashes on my body that wouldn’t let up, so I started treatment even
  before I got the positive blood test result. In my research I learned
  that catching lyme disease early was half the battle. I knew exactly
  when and where I got bit and I had the EM rash to prove I should start
  treatment. http://www.jemsekspecialty.com/lyme_detail.php?sid=6 I
  was under the impression that I would get better with two months of
  heavy antibiotics. I found a lyme disease specialist in San Diego and
  began treatment. When I finished the treatment, I excitedly posted a
  photo of my last antibiotic, determined I was done. However 5 days
  later I got sick - sicker than I had been. It was like the beginnings
  of the flu for two weeks, and soon after found out that my Lyme IgG
  and IgM were still positive. I started a four month long cycle of
  multiple antibiotics and Bicillin injections - intramuscular
  injections every three days. http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3768/bicillin-l-a-im/details I
  also started a long list of supplements, a gluten-dairy-sugar free
  diet and seeing a herbalist for chinese herbs that I took twice a day.
  I believe the herbs, supplement, diet, and water intake kept me
  somewhat functional during that time, but the Lyme was still quickly escalating. When this round of antibiotics was complete, I became sicker again
  two weeks later. It was September, 10 months after my diagnosis, and I
  had worsening physical pain, debilitating exhaustion, and insomnia.
  Some of you have seen my struggles first-hand, talking me down in
  moments of grief, massaging my back when I felt like I could snap in
  two, or literally lying on top of me until I calmed down enough to to
  function. My life is nothing what it used to be. I am less jugemental,
  more loving, more kind, more vulnerable, grounded, and grateful in
  ways I've never been. I'm also so tired that it's difficult to hold my
  head up most nights or sit up straight for too long. It feels like a
  ceiling is coming down on me. On any given day I struggle with
  fatigue, persistent muscle twitching, poor ciruclation, numbness/
  tingling of my extremities, insomnia, migratory joint pain, muscle
  pain / fatigue, brain fog, poor memory, concentration issues, anxiety,
  heart palpitations, lightheadedness / dizziness, blurry vision, and
  auditory pain. I gave up all my extracurricular activities, accepting that if I was
  going to get better, I had to rest every moment I could. I started
  antibiotics again and was on them for a month when I gave up. After a
  lot of consideration, research, and medical trial and error, I decided
  that the antibiotics weren't going to cure me. I had tried for 10
  months and was only getting worse. I now had two options - to do a
  PICC line or to go entirely natural. http://lymelens.com/picc-your-poison I need to do a fundraiser because health insurance doesn’t cover
  either option. With natural treatments, I’ve found several that have
  cured friends with similar cases, as well as effective treatments that
  I’ve already begun. If you're interested or need more information than
  what is provided please email me and I can give you specific details,
  but here is the general outline: • I will be getting peptide shots in Florida starting at the end of
  the month. From the referrals I’ve been given, I’m the most excited
  and confident about this treatment. I am also doing essential oils,
  prescribed by my specialist in San Diego. http://restormedicine.com/essential-oils-in-lyme-disease-treatment/ • I do BioEnergetics every three weeks, which has been tremendously
  helpful http://www.naturalallergyrelief.com/about-bie.html My
  herbalist gives me bi-weekly personalized Chinese herbs for treating
  my immune dysfunction, antibiotic side-effects, and Lyme and
  co-infections http://universalfamilyclinic.com/practitioners.html • I also use Methylation( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4uqEDK6BvM
  ) acupuncture, supplements, meditation, eat a healthy diet and rest. Thank you for reading my story and helping me. It’s terrifying to be
  this vulnerable. I wish this wasn’t happening but I’m learning
  tremendous things about myself, life, and love.  It is not under ideal
  circumstances, but this life experience, for me, has shone a light on
  how amazing us humans are in supporting one another, and how strong we
  are as a unit. I am so grateful to those of you who have shown up for
  me with your whole hearts and loved me through all of those moments
  when it seemed impossible to love myself.  I want to get better so
  badly so that I can share a big ol' revitalized piece of my heart with
  you guys! Thank you.","18,626",of $20k goal,https://fundrazr.com/bx479,Help Jackie Get Healthy,275,,U.S. Dollar

"As some of you (most of you by now!) probably know, the MS foundation
  is a charity incredibly close to my heart. 2 years ago, my brother was
  diagnosed with this incurable and incredibly unpredictable disease and
  it turned his life, and my family's, to turmoil. The years have been difficult, scary, painful, ambiguous, result
  after result, change after change... But there's only one thing that
  kept me going. I made it my aim to ensure I would make the best of a
  terrible situation, and raise as much money as conceivable for the
  amazing charity supporting sufferers of MS. Those of you who have
  friends, family or loved ones with Multiple Sclerosis will know how
  vital it is that they persevere in their research until they find a cure. This time, we are skydiving. My four incredible best friends have all
  agreed to embark on this journey with me, and we will be jumping
  12,000ft from a plane with the aim of raising £2,000 for the MS Foundation. Please help us by digging as far as your pockets will allow, and
  donate anything that you can spare to give. All of your kindness in
  the past has been overwhelming, and today I have just one more ask:

"Hey everyone, thanks for coming to my donation page.  I asking for
  donations to support two MS missions this year: the Bike MS Ride and
  the Living MS Virginia special license plate campaign. Everyone who donates this year will be eligible to win one of the following: Zip Line Tour for two from EMPOWER ADVENTURES Ladies Basic Pistol Class from ELITE SHOOTING SPORTS Thanks, Mike I'm Mike Donaldson, the Founder and President of the Living MS
  Society with a brief message about who I am, what I believe in and
  what we are going to accomplish together. I've been a police officer since 1995, but the truth is I wanted
  to be a protector much earlier than that.   In 2001, I was chosen for
  my police department's SWAT Team. Since joining our SWAT Team, I have
  participated in over 1,300 high-risk operations. However, none of my
  training or skills could protect my wife, Beth, from being diagnosed
  with Multiple Sclerosis in May of 2011. Despite a history of MS on her side of the family, we were caught
  off guard by the diagnosis. Beth knew more about MS than I did, but
  that wasn't saying much since I knew next to nothing. Since her
  diagnosis in 2011, Beth is on her 3rd different MS medication in 5
  years. The medication is not a cure, but only an attempt to slow the
  progression, treat her relapses and manage the symptoms. Each year since 2011, I have participated in the local Bike MS
  charity ride, which is run by the National MS Society. Our friends and
  family have helped us raise more than $18,950 towards the cause. I
  believe the Natl. MS Society is a good organization and I plan
  continue to participate in the ride each year. A couple months ago I happened to read a story about the creation
  of childhood cancer plates and the family behind the effort. I thought
  to myself how the license plates are a great way to spread awareness,
  especially in NoVA where we're all stuck sitting in traffic 24/7. After checking the VA DMV website, I learned that MS Awareness
  plates did not exist. I decided right there and then that I would get
  this done...and that was the beginning of the Living MS Society. I am going to get the bill sponsored, passed and signed by the Governor. Here's what I need help with: Donations .  There's no other way to say it.  My
    statewide effort to get the message out about the MS License plates
    campaign takes financial help. I need volunteers from around the state of
      VA to help spread the word to areas I do not have
    a network. If you would like to order a MS plate of your
    own , please go to LivingMS.org and request the
    form by signing up. The license plates are our short term goal. Our long term goal is
  to raise donations, so that we may support research towards finding a
  cause of Multiple Sclerosis. Most charities focus on finding a cure. If you google the term
  ""for the cure,"" you will get results for race for the cure,
  ride for the cure, run for the cure, bowl for the cure...you get the
  point. Supporting research to find a cure is a noble cause and I am
  not calling for an end to those efforts, but I have a different mindset. The cure for a broken arm is a cast. The cure for a cavity is a
  visit to the dentist. The cure for a gunshot wound is successful
  surgery. Thank God for cures, for if I had a broken arm, or a cavity,
  or if I were to get shot on a high risk operation while at work - I'd
  be grateful my doctor knew what to do. Here at the Living MS Society our goal is to prevent the broken
  arm, the cavity and the gun shot would from ever happening. If we can
  discover what causes MS, we won't need to find a pharmaceutical cure
  for MS.  Therefore, we intend to support those researchers seeking a
  cause for MS, and let others chase after a cure. Thank you for supporting me and Beth in this effort to get the MS
  plates and the BIke MS ride. Thanks, Mike","3,855",of $6k goal,https://fundrazr.com/417Mz7,Donate to Mike D's LivingMS.org - Bike MS Ride,71,,U.S. Dollar

"I am Erick, a humanitarian/development professional in the past seven
  years of my immediate employment/career. I am Joey's friend, having
  known each other since nursing school in 2002 up to this day. Joey was diagnosed with multiple cerebral abscess and cerebral
  infarct which put him into the intensive care unit for a month.
  He sufferred two major cardio-respiratory arrests and had been in life
  and death situation. Joey courageously survived these difficult times.
  His medical bills amounted to 645,000 pesos or US $14,300 (1$=45PhP)
  upon discharge - an amount Joey has painstakingly tried to pay but to
  no avail. Currently, Joey is on rehabilitation. An expert team of doctors in
  General Santos City, Southern Philippines where he is based, requires
  him to undergo series of laboratory and diagnostic tests (Ultrasound,
  CT Scan and MRI) quarterly. These rehabilitation interventions cost
  70,000 pesos or US $1,555 every three months. Bills from his previous
  hospitalization have remained unpaid while new ones pile up to one another. Joey has since stopped working as a nurse, a sad reality brought
  about by the complications of his condition. It was not a choice not
  to practice his profession, but he has been advised not to considering
  his physical limitations. He relies solely on his meager income
  (approximately 175 USD/net monthly income) as an office clerk to
  support his maintenance medications (bought from Australia), survive
  each day like all people and continue paying his hospital bills. At
  times, the generosity of friends finds its way to Joey's end. His
  parents have no source of income and despite the will to work and earn
  more, his frail body could no longer cooperate. The idea of this fund raiser is for our common friends, former
  classmates, colleagues (and those whose kind hearts are touched by
  this call) to help Joey stand up again by wiping out his previous
  hospital bills, help pay for his on-going rehab and to leave him with
  a little amount to buy his pressing needs in the immediate future. Let's help our fellow Angel in the sickroom get back to his feet
  again. Save that $5 Starbucks coffee and Bagel or that $10 dinner at
  your favorite restaurant or that $20 shirt you want to buy and send it

"Felix has had problems with his digestive system since birth. His last biopsy showed that his intestine does not contain nerve cells. He can be days, even weeks without having bowel movements and when he does, it is usually the size of a pop can or even larger. Felix has been through so much in the past 9 years. At the age of 2, he started to have enemas every week until he was 6. Many rectal exams, in-tubing, days without eating, barium enemas and the list goes on. Since his birth, we have had to travel to major urban centers to seek care and answers. We finally met the perfect match in Halifax at the IWK Children's Hospital. We have a dream team with his pediatric gastroenterologist Dr,.Gamal Mahdi and gastroenterologist surgeon Dr.Romao that follows Felix and takes every step necessary to find the root of the problem. His next major biopsy will occur the first week of October 2013. They will try to find how far does the lack of nerve cells go and test for Hirshprung disease. From there, Montreal's Ste-Justine Children Hospital will be taking over. He currently takes copious amounts of PEG3500, Senna and Ducolax which is not covered by any medical insurance. His mother has to be home to orchestrate every medical appointments, stay at home with Felix when he is not feeling well with stomach pains (He does miss a lot of school because of it). We are on one income and with the amount of travel we have already done and will have to do in the coming years, his medical team suggested the idea of fundraising. So here we are asking for your support. One thing is for sure though, Felix's Spirit remains high through all this ordeal. He is very brave and always makes sure that our spirit remains high as well! Félix a des problèmes avec son système digestif depuis la naissance. Sa dernière biopsie a révélé que ses intestins ne contiennent pas de cellules nerveuses. Il peut être des jours, des semaines sans faire des selles et quand il le fait, c'est généralement la taille d'une canette de boisson gazeuse ou même plus gros. Félix a vécu tellement de choses au cours des 9 dernières années. À l'âge de 2 ans, il a commencé à avoir des lavements chaque semaine jusqu'à ses 6 ans. De nombreux examens rectaux, intubé du nez à l’intestin, des jours sans manger, lavements barytés et la liste continue. Depuis sa naissance, nous avons dû se déplacer vers les grands centres urbains pour obtenir des soins et des réponses. Nous avons finalement rencontré le match parfait à Halifax à l'Hôpital pour enfants IWK. Nous avons finalement une équipe de rêve avec son pédiatre gastroentérologue Dr. Gamal Mahdi et gastroentérologue chirurgien Dr.Romao. Ils suivent Félix depuis 2 ans et prennent toutes mesures nécessaires pour trouver la racine du problème. Sa prochaine grande biopsie aura lieu la première semaine d'Octobre 2013. Le chirurgien effectura plusieurs prélèvements tout le long des intestins. Ils vont aussi essayer de déterminer si Félix souffre de la maladie Hirshprung . De là, l'hôpital pour enfants Sainte-Justine de Montréal, prendra la relève. Il prend actuellement de grandes quantités de PEG3500, Senna et Ducolax qui ne sont pas couverts par les assurances médicales. Sa mère doit être à la maison pour orchestrer tous les rendez-vous médicaux, rester à la maison avec Félix quand il ne se sent pas bien avec des douleurs (il manque beaucoup  d'école ). Nous avons un seul revenu depuis que nous avons commencé à voyager pour Félix. Les montants des voyages que nous avons déjà fait et nous aurons à faire dans l’années à venir est exorbitant, son équipe médicale a suggéré l'idée de collecte de fonds. Donc, ici, nous faisons appel à votre soutien. Une chose certaine cependant, l'Esprit de Félix reste élevé malgré les épreuves. Il est très courageux et fait toujours en sorte que notre esprit reste élevée aussi !","4,025",,https://fundrazr.com/5b7V9,Help Felix with medical expenses!,,,
"Bienvenidos! We are so glad you are here! Thanks for taking a moment
  to visit our fund raising campaign for Adair Delagacz Pilka. Adair was born in Brazil to his loving parents, Magdalena
  Delegacz and Adrian Pilka from Poland. We recently celebrated Adair’s
  18th birthday on November 24th, 2015. I first met Adair in Ecuador where he was struggling with what
  appeared to be a complex mental disorder. From the first few moments that my daughter Estrella and I met
  him, he captured our hearts - we resonated deeply with his spirit.
  There are times in one’s life where we may not know the reasons why,
  but we know we are being called to take action; this calling was so
  clear for me to invite Adair into our family to live with us and he
  joyfully accepted. My daughter and Adair spent many hours together
  getting to know one another while sharing their mutual love for
  creating art and developed a close bond similar to that of a brother
  and sister. He easily became a part of our family. We never had any experience with a person in the midst of a
  psychological crisis and have learned so much from Adair. He has been
  a great teacher for us, through his innocence, playfulness and
  authenticity. Adair has taught me about truly being in the present
  moment. Unencumbered by social nuance, he expresses his genuine
  feelings in the moment. This is one of the gifts of his current condition. Adair, Estrella and I journeyed to Peru to seek out the help of
  traditional indigenous healers that may be able to guide him in
  navigating his reality in addition to conventional medical help. While
  in Lima, Peru, Adair had an MRI scan and was diagnosed with a small
  lesion in his nucleus cuadate. Adair also experiences gelastic
  seizures, which cause him to laugh uncontrollably at times and
  exhibits the classic symptoms of schizophrenia. He is suffering a
  severe mental and emotional crisis which desperately needs psychiatric
  care so that he may safely stabilize. Four months ago, we were seeking mental health services for
  Adair. While he was being evaluated by a neurologist at San Jose
  Hospital, Adair jumped out of their 6 story building. San Jose
  Hospital is a private hospital that was recommended as the best
  hospital in Cusco, Peru. We were there to get him the mental health
  services he so desperately needs, but the private hospital was not
  equipped to receive him. Miraculously, Adair only broke 2 bones in his leg and 1 in his
  wrist. He was in ICU for a week and we got the opinions of 3 doctors;
  each one of them told us that the only way to heal his broken bones
  was with surgery. The care we received in the hospital was substandard
  and lead me to question the effectiveness of going through a series of
  surgeries with the risk of infection, and the other long term
  consequences of this type of surgery. I had previous experiences in my travels with traditional
  healing from bone doctors, witnessing people travel from many first
  world nations to Ubud, Bali for these specialized treatments.
  Traditional Balinese healer Dr. Pak Sirkus gave care to two of my
  children for broken bones that completely healed their injuries. I
  wanted to try this option before resorting to surgery and was told
  that there was a famous bone doctor by the name of Dr. Mariano Tapia
  with a clinic in the Cusco region. The people in the Sacred Valley of
  Peru know him well, as he has helped many people heal their broken
  bones; everyday there is a long line of patients who await his
  services outside his clinic. The father of Adair, Adrian Pilka and I
  took Adair there and showed him all his x-rays. Dr. Tapia was
  absolutely confident that he could heal Adair’s broken bones. He
  treated him for 3 months and his bones have completely healed without
  the risky surgery. I tell this story to emphasize that there are
  alternative methods available that Adair has responded successfully
  to; in the healing of Adair’s bones, we witnessed what most
  conventional medical doctors would refer to as a miracle. After Adair’s bones healed, we again sought conventional
  medical and psychiatric help. There is only one psychiatric hospital
  in Cusco and it turned us away the first time we visited, as did every
  public and private hospital in Cusco for various reasons. Adair became
  increasingly aggressive as his condition was untreated; he went deeper
  and deeper out of touch with this reality. On our second attempt, Adair was finally admitted to
  Almudena Psychiatric Hospital on December 2nd, 2015. Almudena is
  Cusco’s only psychiatric hospital and is a temporary situation as
  Almudena is only equipped to get patients stabilized within a short
  time frame. We hope to get the proper medications diagnosed to
  stabilize him so we, Magdalena and myself, may travel safely with him
  to a hospital better suited to his long term needs. As he entered the
  hospital, I asked Adair “What do you want” as he was being given
  injections that would put him to sleep for the next 5 days. He
  answered very clearly, “I want love & spiritual healing.” Adair’s parents and I are deeply concerned that he receives the
  best quality care, the safety he needs, in an environment that may
  facilitate his growth and healing in both the physical and spiritual
  aspects of his current experience. We very much want to honor his
  request for love and spiritual healing. Through the work of Phil Borges and his documentary Crazywise,
  we have found Hospital Euripedes in Goiania, Brazil; they are
  specifically equipped to handle cases such as Adair’s and are able to
  accept him right away. Hospital Euripedes is situated in a beautiful and natural
  setting near Brazil’s capital, Brasilia. Euripedes offers modern
  conventional psychiatric services as well as dynamic spiritual support
  and complementary holistic treatments. They also offer art and music
  therapies, as well as organic gardening. We were amazed to find that
  the hospital integrates the work of Alan Kardec and the use of
  Spiritist mediums. These mediums offer spiritual healing services free of
  charge. A basic principle of Spiritist mediums is “What has been given
  for free by God should be freely given to others.” It was interesting
  to find that the majority of the mediums working in this hospital had
  previously suffered a severe mental emotional crisis of their own and
  recovered before undergoing the long-term training to become fully
  qualified to work as Spiritist mediums at the hospital. Their personal
  experience gives them the compassion and empathy towards people going
  through similar challenges as well as the unique perspective, that
  healing is possible. Getting Adair there will be quite an adventure, as he must be
  properly medicated and have a male assistant to protect him and
  others. We are seeking emergency help from the Brazilian Consulate as
  Adair is a Brazilian citizen; since he was born in Brazil, he is
  entitled to Brazilian citizenship and many free medical care services there. Like his bones healing, we are confident that once again Adair
  will have a healing miracle occur in Brazil with help from the
  professionals of this integrated model of care offered by Euripedes Hospital. Adair lives quite frequently in his own world where he hears
  voices, one of the symptoms associated with schizophrenia (See the
  link below for the organization called Intervoices for more
  information). It has become increasingly apparent in the 9 months we
  have lived together, that he is incredibly intuitive and exhibits
  clairvoyant abilities. People who have had the opportunity to meet and
  work with Adair have expressed to me their similar experiences. These
  qualities are ones that I would like Adair to receive guidance with
  and develop further. After watching the documentary Crazywise, I can
  see that he has been given these gifts amidst what appears, in a
  modern sense, to be solely symptoms of a complete psychotic break. Adair is an incredibly talented artist and spends many hours a
  day fully immersed in creating art. Music is another one of his
  passions, as well as organic gardening! I hope you feel as we do that
  Euripides Hospital can meet Adair’s request to “Feel love &
  spiritual healing” while having an opportunity do the activities he
  loves and has a passion for. This meets his needs as well our needs
  for Adair to be safe and lead an engaged life. We have faith that
  immersing him in Euripedes' enviornment, that is supportive of every
  aspect of his healing needs, will encourage him to thrive and
  facilitate a break through for his recovery. I am in the process of writing a book about the life and
  amazing healing journey of Adair, of which the proceeds will be put
  into a trust fund for his continued care. The book will include the
  details of Adair’s continuing story in Brazil. It is my hope that his
  healing journey will be able to offer assistance to others who are
  traveling down a similar road; that it will offer some insights,
  inspiration and guidance for those that may be looking for the best in
  conventional medical and psychiatric treatments, integrated with world
  wisdom traditions. We hope you will be a part this miraculous story too with your
  enthusiasm and good will. Our current, most pressing need is to
  transport Adair safely to Brazil. This fundraising campaign is to help
  offset the financial costs to make this a reality. If you in any way
  feel called or inspired to help, we accept your gift of a
  contribution, no matter the size, with the greatest appreciation - may
  what you give from your heart come back to you a million times over.
  And of course, your well wishes are deeply appreciated as we navigate
  this next step of Adair’s journey. For each person who donates any amount, we would like to invite
  you to join our closed Facebook group, giving periodic updates on
  Adair’s care and progress. Those people making donations of $25.00 or
  more, will be given the ebook as a gift when it is completed plus
  access to the Facebook group updates. There were times when I was living alone with Adair and had
  entered a state of despair and total loss of direction while he was
  breaking. I too was breaking as his caregiver, especially living in
  Peru where the resources are limited. Yet there is a light; a path
  emerging and a clarity. I experienced that healing happens in
  community and when Adair’s mother, Magdalena, joined me in his care
  along with her lovely adopted daughter Emelia who is 14 and adores
  Adair, I felt relieved and hopeful to receive the support needed to
  facilitate healing for Adair. Magdalena comes offering her skills as a
  translator (Polish, Spanish and Portuguese), and her diligent care of
  Adair, the care in which only a mother can give, is beautiful to witness. This is not only Adair’s story, it is a story to be shared with
  many. The documentary Crazywise gave me a deep understanding into the
  indigenous approach to situations such as his. Crazywise inspired the
  missing link (Euripedes Hospital) I was looking for as I researched
  the options that lay before us. Before watching the documentary, I
  felt limited to take action based solely on his conventional medical
  mental diagnosis, wanting to honor that he is also in need of
  spiritual guidance. I have always known, without a doubt, that Adair
  is destined to come out of this and to reemerge to share his gifts. Magdalena Delagacz, the mother of Adair, and I are planning on
  leaving for Brazil by January 25th, 2015. We hope to meet our goal of
  raising $1,600 by this date, and will continue to accept any donations
  coming in after this date for Adair’s continued care. Any donations
  exceeding our goal will go directly towards Adair’s complementary care
  that may not be covered by Brazil’s health care plan and his continued
  basic needs. Please share this FundRazer campaign link with anyone you may
  know that may like to help out and would be touched by Adair’s
  compelling story. If you are able to make a donation now, as this is
  an emergency situation, this will be of great help. Going on this journey has been complicated, intense,
  overwhelming, but most of all, filled with joy! It is in the giving
  that we are receiving. In turn, I have received from Adair so many
  unexpected gifts. May his story, his life touch you as well. Wishing you all the best and thanking you for reading. Sincerely, Rosa Priya &  Magdalena Delegacz We are really grateful for those that have come forward to help

"Hi! Meet Kyla! Kyla, experienced a lack of oxygen at birth called Hypoxic Ischemic
  Encephalopathy (HIE). As a result of the HIE, Kyla has been diagnosed
  with Cerebral Palsy, Cortical Visual Impairment, developmental delays,
  and has had many other challenges in her short life. She has a big
  team of specialists and is in seven therapies right now! Cerebral Palsy makes everything Kyla tries to do challenging. She is
  not mobile and is also non-verbal. But, she is also silly, loves to
  have fun, and definitely finds ways to show us her opinions! In 2014 and 2015, we fundraised for Kyla to go to Panama for Stem
  Cell treatments and for her extra therapy needs! We had a lot of
  amazing help and have been so grateful for the support and love Kyla received! Kyla's whole life has pretty much revolved around her hectic therapy
  schedule, usually having at least 4-5 hours a week! Kyla will also
  turn 3 in September and will age out of her Early Intervention program
  and then will start school. We've sold our quad level house and will
  be moving into a ranch style home next month! It's going to be great
  for her! So, for this summer, although she will still continue with
    therapy, we want to try to focus on making sure she still gets to be
    a kid and have FUN! We would like to help Kyla enjoy things
  that other kids love! A fun summer! Bike riding, swimming, swinging,
  and getting out, and taking adventures! Unfortunately, due to her
  special needs, things can get really pricey when it comes to buying
  things for her to have fun! For 2016's T-Shirt and FundRazr campaign we want to
    focus Kyla's FUN-raising on a few main things! --- Special needs swing and frame for her new
  backyard. Kyla LOVES swinging and having one at home would be amazing
  for her! --- Ramp for Kyla's new house! We are moving soon
  into a ranch style house for Kyla! Everything she needs will now be
  all on one floor! We will need to build a ramp in the attached garage
  so that Kyla can roll from inside the house right out of the garage to
  the driveway. This will give us more opportunities to take her outside
  in all of her different pieces of equipment, let her go on walks and
  adventures more easily, and will let us roll her from the house right
  onto the bus when she starts school! --- A new Taga 2.0 Bike! Kyla didn't win a bike in the contest we tried for, and since they
  are several thousand dollars, we're working with a nationwide
  foundation in hopes to have one funded! In the meantime, we learned
  about the Taga 2.0 that launched on Kickstarter! We were able to get
  it at a great early-bird price! They'll be starting to make them this
  summer and shoud ship in the early fall! It's a bike that adults ride
  and has a space for Kyla to sit in a reclining seat in front of us! No
  more stopping to adjust her in a bike trailer behind us! She's going
  to love it! Thank you so much for all of the love and support for Kyla! And, for
  helping us give her things we know she'll thrive in and have fun with!",515,of $2.5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/KylaSummerFun,Kyla's Korner FUN-raiser!,11,,U.S. Dollar

  healthy and happy, and looking forward to his future ahead. A keen
  footballer and sportsman he practically lived in his trainers.  That
  all came to an abrupt halt in June 2014 when he started feeling pain
  in his hip joints. After many tests, Kevin was diagnosed with bone
  cancer in his pelvis. As the tumour is extremely advanced the doctors opinion is that he
  needs radical surgery to remove part of his pelvis (and possibly his
  hip joint),  and then reconstruct them using custom made metal
  implants. Facilities for this are obviously not available in Barbados,
  and therefore Kevin and his Mum Wendy are flying to Canada for his treatment. Luckily the foresight of his loving parents ensured that he was
  covered by Medical Insurance which is covering the majority of the 225
  000 USD which is needed to perform the surgery required. However, as you can imagine although the insurance is covering some
  of the costs, they don't cover all of the costs and that is where
  friends, and family and the goodwill of you, come in. We're raising funds to cover the 20 % excess not covered by the
  insurance, expenses whilst in Canada and the additional expenses that
  will be needed for Kevin's rehabilitation. Anything you can give will be gratefully and lovingly received and

"Hello Lance Mackey Mushing Fans- As you have likely heard, Lance Mackey scratched from the 2016
  Iditarod due to personal health concerns. If you follow him on
  Facebook, you know his fingers were infected. Well, they’re infected
  badly and are not getting any better without further treatment. Lance
  has accumulated well over $7000.00 in medical and dental bills so far
  with more to come. The Lance Mackey Medical Fund (LMMF for short) in 2014 successfully
  raised enough donations to address Lance’s expensive dental work (you
  can read about that campaign here:
  https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/3g2Dd). Lance was ever so grateful for
  everyone’s help - it made a huge difference and he was able to heal
  and continue to pursue his dream. With Lance’s fingers, and teeth,
  requiring further treatment, we are reaching out again for your help.
  Every little bit helps and we would be so grateful if you could help
  Lance out again to save his fingers. Due to the graphic nature of the
  finger photos, we will not be posting them here - you can see them on
  Lance’s Facebook Page. Note that for IRS rules, these are “ gifts ” to Lance and
  your donations to the LMMF are NOT tax-deductible. LMMF uses your
  donations to pay for those medical expenses allowed by Publication 502
  from the IRS, and for the minimal expenses of operating LMMF
  (PayPal and Fundrazr.com fees, banking fees, postage, etc.  The LMMF
  Board are all volunteers donating their time, talent and computers).
  IRS Rules in Pub. 502 allows for payment of Lance’s medical bills,
  reimbursement for mileage ($0.19/mile for travel to/from medical
  appointments), lodging when away from home (such as for the hyperbaric
  treatments in Anchorage, a generous $50.00 per night), and others you
  can read about here: https://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ar02.html; and about the gift exemptions here: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes If you prefer to donate to Lance directly, you can find his
  address on his Comeback Kennel website and send him a check. http://lancemackey.com/ Here’s an update from Lance (slightly edited) to let you know
  how he’s doing and what’s coming up this summer and next season: Ok well I to finally got a full mouth of teeth this May 2nd.
  It's been three years since they pulled them all - it’s been a long
  road and I hope I’m done, but you never know. I had 2 months of
  hyperbaric treatments, then 6 months of healing before putting in the
  posts, and another 6 more months for them to set. Then came the molds,
  the temporary teeth (not to mention those awful dentures). Then they
  were able to put in the bottom set that are permanent. Those had to
  heal up and then be readjusted. So the dentist starts with the top set
  only to find out the posts were to short to hold them in so then we
  had to redo the top posts. Wait again for those to heal, take more
  molds, make the teeth and wait. May 2nd couldn’t have come soon
  enough! It’s actually been since 2001 since I had a full set of teeth. Now there are my infected fingers. Who knew!? But I should have
  known better. I have Mersa in my fingers. This is the reason they had
  to remove my teeth, fear of infection. So here I now sit with a
  picc-line (A peripherally inserted central catheter or “PICC”)
  straight to the heart to administer some heavy duty antibiotics that
  were paid for by some of the last bit of money in the LMMF. It’s been
  3 weeks so far and I have another 1 to 6 weeks of treatment. It looks
  like my fingers will be saved. The bad part is that I will always have
  issues with serious infection. So I’m going to need several expensive
  prescriptions forever to keep it at bay. The great news --I have a badass team of young, big, mouthy,
  strong boys that will win many races this coming season. I only say
  that because it's true, not cocky. Good crew, good support (Thank YOU

"Here are the facts that get us mad & can send us into a rage;
  Cancer affects 1 in every 2 men and 1 in every 3 women at some point
  in their lifetime. Chances are you know at least ONE OTHER person who
  has cancer and whose lives & those of their family have been
  turned upside-down; emotionally, spiritually and certainly, financially! Today, I am asking for your support; both as a patient and as one of
  the 90,000 people in the US alone, fighting Multiple Myeloma. Together
  with your help we can assist the International Myeloma Foundation and
  the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation to raise funds for drug
  research, new treatments & new clinical trials … and bring
  awareness to an overlooked killer. Multiple Myeloma is the 2nd most common blood cancers & has three
  stages, the 3rd having multiple bone fractures and deterioration; yet
  this cancer flies under the radar & goes under-rated. But with our
  efforts, new drug research & treatments can give 90,000 patients
  & their families’ encouragement.  A few short years ago, the
  average survival rate was 2–5 years; as of 2012, that rate had
  increased to 7–10 years with reports of a few patients still fighting
  after 15-years plus. One key factor of the increased life expectancy,
  noted by every oncologist interviewed, was to possess a positive
  attitude. Patients are living longer and fighting their cancer with an
  optimistic courage, in part through the new treatment & clinical
  trials that introduce new drugs and therapies. Caring supporters &
  generous friends like you play a critical role in these treatment
  breakthroughs and the confidence of the patient. Your generous financial gift means the doctors & scientists can
  fund their research, introduce new drugs, finance new programs &
  clinical trials. The collected donations will be added to the funds
  raised by the charitable golf outings and golf skill events organized
  throughout the year. With the golf theme in mind, join me and every
  golf enthusiast & pro-golfer alike … At the very least, we can
  increase awareness & help to give cancer fighters back valuable
  time & renewed courage to never stop fighting. As a thank you for your donation, you will receive a “Blood-Red”
  Golfer’s Trion:Z magnetic-therapy wristband. Wear it with pride as a
  symbol of your support of Multiple Myeloma. LET’S GET MAD … LET'S  “TEE  OFF  ON  CANCER”!","1,730",of $15k goal,https://fundrazr.com/Tee-Off-On-Cancer,Tee Off on Cancer - Get Mad at Multiple Myeloma,14,,U.S. Dollar

"My name is Joyce H,, and I am asking for help for my friend Bast, and
  her mom, Roberta. Why is a fundrazr for car repairs under health? Their only vehicle is currently undrivable, the brakes failed
  completely and the tires have dry rot. Roberta and Bast both have
  serious health conditions requiring visits to the doctor several times
  a month, including an upcoming cancer surgery for Roberta. Without
  their vehicle, these doctor visits and even grocery trips become
  impossible, and these illnesses will quickly become life threatening.
  Where they live, a somewhat rural area, there is NO public transport,
  not even taxi services. The shop has quoted $600 for brake repairs. For the work needed, this
  is a very fair price, and the shop is within walking distance. The
  only factor is their extremely limited income, which has been badly
  impacted by increased property tax and medical bills. Tires would be
  another $400 or so, and will need to be replaced before a blowout
  kills someone. If you can help, please do. If you can make others who may be able to
  help aware, please do. The smallest gift would go far. These are good

"Gennine is a native of Trinidad and Tobago. She is a single
    mother of a 14 year old son and an 11 year old daughter. She has
    dedicated much of her life to helping at risk children and their
    families as well as those with disabilities. She worked for Jewish
    Child and Family Services for 10 years where she received awards for
    professional excellence and gained the respect of her colleagues.
    She has worked with ChildServe in Iowa since 2013 with children who
    have disabilities and their families. In 2010 Gennine was diagnosed with an extreme case of sinus
    tachycardia. This is a heart condition that causes ones heart to
    beat excessively or rapidly. Gennine started treatment for this
    condition but did not let that deter her from her responsibilities
    as a mother, daughter, sister, friend and colleague. There were many
    days when the illness got the better of Gennine but her faith, her
    children, her family and friends kept her going. Over the years
    Gennine’s heart has been slowly getting weaker and has started to
    affect her everyday life functioning. She tires easily and is not
    able to do as much as she use to or would like to. In 2011 as Gennine was dealing with the effects tachycardia was
    having on her emotionally and physically, she was diagnosed with
    stage 2 cervical cancer. While the rest of us around her were
    devastated she said “I am giving myself 24 hours to cry about this
    and after that I am moving on”. Moving on is exactly what Gennine
    did. She went through chemo and radiation therapy and continued to
    work full time. Gennine would often say that there are many people
    so much worse off than me that I am truly grateful that this is all
    I have to deal with. She was determined to beat the disease and she
    did. Gennine was in remission for almost 12 months before having to
    deal with cervical cancer yet again. She fought through again, still
    working full time and taking her son to football practice and her
    daughter to gymnastics. Once again Gennine beat the disease. Towards the end of 2015 Gennine’s heart condition was starting
    to cause her heart muscles to weaken. As her cardiologist was making
    plans to address this issue Gennine was diagnosed with Cervical
    cancer again. Due to the pain and the rate the cancer cells were
    spreading Gennine’s quality of life is severely impacted. For the
    first time she is unable to work. The short-term disability policy
    she has been paying into to cover her and her children for
    circumstances such as these has at this time refused to pay out on
    her policy. She continues to work with them to provide the missing
    information she is told they need. In the mean time she has two
    children who depend on her and everyday things that we take for
    granted she is struggling to accomplish both physically and
    financially. Gennine’s sister Aisha says it best “She has been fighting this
    battle for such a long time but with such a brave face, for the sake
    of those who love her and whom she loves in return, that you wonder,
    where she finds the strength to do it each day”. Gennine’s family and friends are asking for any assistance that
    you can provide her in this challenging time. Gennine keeps saying I
    am PUSHing (Praying Until Something Happens) forward. Please pray

"My name is Jessica, and I have the pleasure of knowing a very special
  woman, Patricia ""Trish.""  Her heart of gold shines in every
  aspect of her life, there isn't anything this woman wouldn't do for a
  person in need.  Myself being from Boston, moving to Texas and meeting
  Trish was my first impression of true Southern Hospitality &
  Class!  Always put together, if there was one thing to say about my
  new friend, she always presented herself with dignity and showed
  respect to absolutely everyone she came across. Trish is a homecare nurse.  This means she spends hours in the homes
  of medically fragile patients, helping them and their families learn
  to cope with the incredible amount of work and emotions that go into a
  life of special needs.  For example, when babygirl came home from the
  hospital with a feeding tube, ventilator, and trach (to help her
  survive a traumatic event after birth) her life immediately consisted
  of medical machines, medications hard to pronounce, and a long list of
  diagnoses.  Trish stepped into the home and instantly brought a sense
  of calm understanding and care.  Overtime, she became an irreplaceable
  part of their family. Now I come to you with a heartfelt request.  Trish went from working
  full-time selflessly caring for those in great need of skilled medical
  care & emotional support, to taking extended time off and becoming
  a patient herself.  The reality of hospital bills has not even come to
  pass, as her daily cost of living while she is not working seems
  insurmountable on her own.  She needs your help.  No one should have
  to fear losing their home or having the lights shut off on top of
  the battle against a fast and furious diagnosis of cancer. All the money raised will go directly to paying rent, electricity,
  water, insurance, groceries & gas.  We hope to raise enough for
  her to get through at least the next few months of chemo and surgery. 
  If by your generosity, there is additional funding, it will all go
  towards hospital bills as well as covering the cost of hotel stays
  near MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX, while she undergoes treatment. Please consider donating, every little bit helps. With love and gratitude, Jessica M. Kane",630,of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/nurseinneed,Giving Back to a Nurse in Need,9,,U.S. Dollar
"I gave birth to twins prematurely, at barely 26 weeks age of
  gestation. That's because the waterbag of Twin B (Lance) broke too
  early. When Lance's waterbag collapsed, the waterbag of Twin A
  (Andrei) started pushing him towards my left iliac, causing physical
  trauma to my poor angel. Despite what happened, the monitors showed that both hearts were
  still beating. When they were extracted from my womb via CS, none of
  them cried nor reached 1kilogram in weight. Lance had to be revived from having a flatline. He had a deformed
  skull, displaced ribcage, and bruises all over him. He had
  pneumothorax and had to be punctured through needling twice. Yet the
  first time I visited him at Day 2, he was dancing to his Dadda's
  singing. He was responsive and was smiling to my words of affection.
  At Day 6, he had not yet peed, he had anasarca (generalized swelling),
  he had to be injected 3 isotopes for his heart to contract, and had
  gone less and less responsive to our voices. He had been transfused
  with RBC twice and 3 units of platelets. He had been medicated with a
  mild diuretic and had not been responding to it. We looked for a
  stronger diuretic which might urge him to pee, because the option to
  have him undergo peritoneal dialysis had gone dim after finding out
  that his peritoneal wall could no longer accommodate the procedure.
  The strong diuretic was a risky option because it would lower his
  already low BP. His running hospital bill at Day 8 had gone up to
  PHP199K+. There were signs of necrosis and I'm afraid we're about lose
  him anytime. Andrei, although his condition was not as bad as Lance, had to be
  incubated, intubated, and be hooked to a ventilator at first. At Day
  5, he was weaned from the ventilator, and had been allowed to drink my
  expressed milk and had progressed from being allowed an intake of 1ml
  per 6 hours, to 1ml per 4 hours, to 1ml per 2 hours. At Day 2, his
  urine output was half less than the normal and his potassium content
  was going high (hyperkalemia), which could trigger a cardiac arrest
  anytime. Good thing that he responded to Furosemide and had peed
  excessively, causing us to replenish the depleting potassium. At
  first, he was not as responsive to our voices as Lance. Lately, it had
  been the other way around. He would cry when we're done with the
  viewing hours. Although, no crying sound comes out from him because of
  the tubes... But I know that he has to stay intubated in an incubator
  so that he will grow and look like a mature baby, so I can take him
  home... At Day 8, his running hospital bill was PHP153K. Andrei seems
  to be responding well to the treatment. As of this writing,  I am still experiencing pain from the surgery,
  have a big bloated tummy, swelling legs--yet I spend almost 12 hours
  everyday to go talk to different specialists, process their documents,
  medical supplies, bills, express milk, worry about finances, pray,
  cry, strategize on how to raise funds, travel 6 hours a day, so that
  my twins will survive. Despite all these, I am thankful to the Lord that he gave me two
  beautiful fighters/warriors who aren't giving up on life despite all
  that they have to go through. We're raising funds so that they can
  undergo the necessary treatment in order to be given a fair fight
  against the plight that they are in. I knock on your hearts, please spare some cash for my twins, Andrei
  and Lance. UPDATE AS OF JULY 21, 2016 Yesterday was the saddest day for us, Lance's frail body surrendered
  to the toxins after 10days of not being able to pee... I lost one of
  my precious warriors. He was a hero up to the last second. The doctors
  said we had to let go. We didn't want to let go. They did 4 full
  cycles of resuscitation, injected 6 epinephrine. His thorax was
  bleeding because of the pressure that his tiny chest had to endure
  everytime they tried to revive him... As a nurse, I know that we
  should already stop after cycle 2 because the process was doing more
  harm to his frail body, but the mother in me could not even find the
  courage to check the items at the DO NOT RESUSCITATE form. The most
  painful thing that a parent can ever experience is to bury a child... ""Goodbye, my precious warrior, Lance. Now, we have a cherubim in
  heaven. Please ask Papa God to heal your twin, Andrei..."" EPILOGUE The battle continues as we await Andrei's recovery.  Although he
  responds well to the treatment,  he remains to be in ICU and aside
  from his running hospital bill,  his stay there would incur a daily
  cash spending of P1, 200 to P12, 000 on TPN, antibiotics,  and random
  procedures that his pediatricians deem necessary for the management of
  his weight,  sepsis,  and whatever complications that might arise

  and I quickly became friends, even though he was 2 years ahead of me
  in school, and I was at least twice his size! His Dad was our baseball
  coach, we went on each one another’s family trips, all the way through
  our senior trips. We double dated , got into trouble, fished, hunted,
  we both got married then divorced and remarried. Our wives became
  friends, we camped, went to NASCAR races, trips to the beach, fishing,
  dinners together, and more. We have the kind of friendship that movies
  are all about! The memories we have will forever be cherished! I have always had medical issues. Bob has never in his adult live
  been sick! Never been to a Doctor! About a month ago now, he had
  started to be sick to his stomach, vomiting and diarrhea. He and his
  wife Kim thought it must just be a bug. But when he wasn’t any better
  after 3 days he went into the local ER. A few test was ran and from
  there they sent him to OSU’s James Cancer Center where he spent
  several days getting test and exams done. After results started coming
  back we were told he had stage 4 colon cancer, and that it had spread
  to his liver. He has several lesions on his liver, one is around 5” in
  length. And on a follow-up appointment this week we have been told it
  has also spread to his lungs. For this to be happening to him is so unbelievable! He has worked all
  his life to take care of his family, never complaining of work or the
  time and hours he has to put into it. Bob and his wife Kim both are employed at Kroger, Bob at Portsmouth
  for 39 years, Kim in Wheelersburg going on 2 years. Neither is able to
  work at this time. And do not know how long they will be off of work.
  Bob cannot be left alone he is pretty weak un able to do some things
  for himself, and has several doctor appointments most of those are 2
  hours away in Columbus Ohio. Like I said he worked all his life to
  have things, so to have things you have payments on things! These

"The Geita Gold Mine Kilimanjaro HIV/AIDS Challenge was started in
    2002 by AngloGold Ashanti at its operation in Geita, Tanzania. Since the humble beginnings of our first expedition in 2002, the
    number of recorded new infections in Tanzania has more than halved.
    The improvement of infrastructure and service delivery in the
    detection, treatment and counseling of infected people and their
    communities through the application of the funds to various
    beneficiaries has played a major role in our commitment to “getting
    to three zeros”. Zero new infections. Zero discrimination. Zero
    HIV/AIDS related deaths. The impact of HIV/AIDS on Tanzania’s population has been
    devastating with many frail elders being left to care for young
    children following the death of the parents because of this disease.
    Often these families do not have the means to support these children
    with many being left without food, water or care. The Geita Gold Mine Kilimanjaro HIV/AIDS Challenge has brought
    hope where there was none before. The building of orphanages,
    schools, clinics, counseling centers and refurbishing existing local
    and regional medical facilities has helped many communities across
    Tanzania to rebuild and flourish. In 2014, a partnership was formed with TACAIDS, the Tanzania
    Commission for Aids, the government department that drives HIV/AIDS
    awareness and treatment in Tanzania. The Geita Gold Mine Kilimanjaro HIV/AIDS Committee, requests your
    support for the landmark 15th Edition of the annual Kilimanjaro
    Challenge HIV/AIDS challenge, which takes place from 16th to 23rd
    July 2016. The Kilimanjaro Challenge has grown from humble
    beginnings since its’ inception in 2002 to a multinational event,

"My grandson Kaden Hoffer, age 12, has been hospitalized since June 20
  after being savagely attacked by three pit bull dogs. He doesn't
  remember being airlifted to Birmingham yet he does remember the
  attack. He was repeatedly screaming, ""I'm gonna die!"", yet
  no one heard his cries. However, Kaden’s 10 year old sister, Truly,
  was shrieking in horror & she was heard by Bailey Buchanan, who is
  pregnant. Bailey risked her & her baby's lives by deflecting the
  attack away from Kaden to herself. Bleeding profusely, Kaden politely
  asked if he could hide from the dogs in McKayla Burgans ’ car. Kaden has endured 5 surgeries to save his left leg & close the
  artery under his right arm. In a few days, they'll do another
    skin graft on his leg if his body does not reject the Integra Dermal
    Regeneration Template, which has a thick underlayer made of pure
    collagen (protein) from cows and a substance called
    glycosaminoglycan made from shark cartilage. There's a very slight
    risk his body will reject the shark & cow cartilage. They won't
    close up his final wound until they are sure that it's connected new
    blood vessels & created tissue around it to bond for a new
    tendon. Kaden is currently stable & healing in his own
  time. He was even able to walk last week with the help of a
    walker. Kaden is looking at a long journey of recovery which
  will likely include several months at a rehabilitation facility. Our family have been overwhelmed with all the support being offered.
  So many of you have graciously reached out & asked how you can
  help. The first thing everyone can do is continue to pray for complete
  healing of Kaden & for the continued efforts of his entire medical team. I’m very proud of my son Chris, a hardworking single dad, who has
  taken the last month off of work to stay at Kaden’s bedside. This is a
  very heavy financial burden when all is said and done. Our goal is for
  Chris, Kaden, & Truly to have one less burden on their plates so
  that they can focus all their time & energy into his healing. Please know that there is no amount that is too small. Every little
  bit will help ease their minds. We appreciate everything in advance! Please continue all of the prayers, as they are being answered each
  & every day! Once again, we cannot express how truly blessed Kaden
  & our family are to have such a huge support system. Please feel
  free to share this link to reach out to all those who are interested
  in helping! Thank you!",800,of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/d19Fc7,Kaden's medical & family fund,16,,U.S. Dollar

"In 2010 I moved, randomly, to Fiji.  Right away I met the kindest,
  gentlest, most inspiring man I will ever know.  He is not educated or
  verbose, but he is smart and giving and warm and welcoming.  He runs
  the village farm, which is responsible for feeding the 300+ members of
  Nasivikoso.  He is a leader in his family and in his community.  I
  found out (he'd never tell me) that he never had money because he was
  secretly sending it for his deceased brother's kids to go to school.
   He paid for them each to go all the way through college- even the
  girls! Yesterday I got a call straight out of my worst nightmares.
   Something is deeply wrong with Junior.  He can no longer walk.  His
  nephews carry him to the toilet.  He has lost most of his weight.  The
  local hospital turned him away and won't see him again for weeks.  He
  was ill for 3 months, suffering flu like symptoms, weight loss and
  numbness in his feet.  Then, feeling better (and being FIjian) he
  played a game of rugby and got a bad hit.  So now we're probably
  dealing with a spinal cord injury on top of whatever mystery illness
  was existing. He needs our help.  He needs money for the journey to the Capitol and
  money for a private hospital.  And he needs an advocate who will push
  and fight for him.  I have no idea what medical costs might be, but I
  know he needs help NOW. With real medical care he can beat this.  His community, his farm and
  my heart need him.  Even if you've never met him, please know that he

    though not blood related, he is our long time acquiantance he was
    with us since he was 11 and now he is 43). He was confined and a
    surgery was done(Colostomy Surgery). Thankfully he is now stable and
    recovering, but he cant be discharged from the hospital unless the
    balance is fully paid. He had the insurance, the company benefits
    but still not able to cover more than half of the bill. The balance
    is 158,000PHP (around 3500USD) and is adding up 1150PHP(25USD) per
    day(roomrental). The hospital is University of Perpetual Help
      Dalta Medical Center, located in the Philippines. When his intestine heals he will go back to the hospital and the
  colostomy bag on his side can be removed, He will have another surgery
  for this again but we will have him at The Philippine General Hospital ( PGH )-government run hospital . Finally this he will also need
  budget for his chemotheraphy. I wanted to help via commissions but the work load will be too

"ENGLISH Jose Antonio is a 6 year old boy living in Guanare,
  Venezuela . In april 2016, he was diagnosed with
  retinoblastoma, or eye cancer, in his left eye at the Hospital
  Universitario Dr. Miguel Oráa, after being hospitalized for a week.
  Days later, his mother abandoned him, leaving him with one of his
  grandmothers, due to limited resources, the grandmother could no
  longer charge. Since then, Guanare’s CMDNNA (a municipal council for children’s
    rights) established Erika Bello, a volunteer from a group named PIA, to care for
    Jose Antonio and the treatment he needs. The cancer treatment Jose Antonio needs is composed of 6
    rounds of chemotherapy every 21 days, and then a surgical procedure at the end of
    chemo to extract his left eye, where the tumor is, the tumor has taken his left optical nerve. To keep Jose Antonio in optimal health, given the effects of
  his treatment he needs to have a balanced diet, including
    fruits, vegetables, and protein such as fish or chicken.
    But due to Venezuela’s difficult economic situation and
    the lack of basic goods such as food, he hasn’t been able to follow the diet he needs; which causes
    fluctuations in his hemoglobin and white blood cells count. Since Jose Antonio is an oncological patient at the Agustín
    Zubillaga Pediatric Hospital in Barquisimeto, he frequently needs to go to the hospital to
    receive his chemotheraphy treatment and to be evaluated by
  his doctors. This means many more expenses, since transportation is
  another thing that’s not cheap in Venezuela. For his next rounds of chemotheraphy, he will need some
    medicines that are impossible to find in Venezuela, due to the circumstances previously explained
    and the health crisis the country is going through. These medicines cannot be found in our
    country, but we need them immediately to continue Jose Antonio’s treatment. These are
    the medicines he needs. SPANISH VERSION José Antonio es un niño de 6 años de edad de la ciudad de
  Guanare, paciente de Retinoblastoma en el ojo izquierdo o lo
  que es lo mismo, cáncer en el ojo. Fue detectado en el mes de abril de
  dicho padecimiento tras una semana de haber sido ingresado por su
  madre (quien lo abandonó días más tarde) al Hospital Universitario Dr
  Miguel Oraá. Luego del abandono de su madre, el niño estuvo al cuidado de su
  abuela paterna, pero debido a los pocos recursos no pudo hacerse
  cargo, el niño pasó a estar bajo medida de protección otorgada por el
  (CMDNNA de Guanare – Portuguesa) a la ciudadana Erika Bello, quien
  actualmente es la encargada de manera voluntaria junto a un grupo de
  jóvenes a través del “Proyecto de Ayuda Integral” (PIA) de poder
  llevar a cabo el tratamiento en la lucha contra el cáncer que enfrenta
  José Antonio. El tratamiento contra el cáncer que sigue el niño está comprendido
  por 6 ciclos de qumioterapias cada 21 días y una intervención
  quirúrgica final de Enucleación Ocular en el ojo donde
  se aloja el tumor. Actualmente el tumor le ha invadido el nervio
  óptico izquierdo. Para mantener los valores altos, el niño José Antonio, debe seguir
  una dieta rica en frutas, vegetales, pescado y pollo, la cual por
  motivos económicos, no puede llevar a cabo regularmente, ocasionando
  altibajos en sus valores, con particular impacto en la hemoglobina,
  leucocitos y glóbulos blancos. Dado que el niño José Antonio es paciente oncológico del Hospital
  Pediátrico Agustin Zubillaga de Barquisimeto, frecuentemente necesita
  trasladarse hasta dicho hospital, para que le puedan ser aplicadas las
  quimioterapias correspondientes a su tratamiento, y ser examinado por
  los médicos tratantes, esto origina aún más gastos extras para el niño
  José Antonio. The money raised will be used to cover the remaining cycles of
    chemotherapies and for the removal of the eye where the tumor is located. We appreciate the help any contribution is small, pray
    for Jose! MEDICAL REPORTS",120,of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/AyudaJoseAntonio,Help the child Jose Antonio win against Cancer,5,,U.S. Dollar

"*If you're using paypal and need my email, use: notjusttheater (at)
  gmail (dot) com* Sunday, July 31, I was hanging out with friends when I got bitten by
  fire ants -- the third time since March, 2016. The previous times I had experienced more extreme reactions than
  most, but this time was different.  Within 15 minutes I began to break
  into hives, all over my body -- I have never broken into hives before
  in my life. Luckily, I was with friends, who suggested Benedryl, and on offering
  to go pick me up some at the drug store I opted to ride along so I
  could take it sooner rather than later. Two blocks after leaving my house I started coughing and generally
  having trouble breathing.  My head was hot and I was having trouble
  turning my head because my neck was so swollen.  I told my friend I
  wanted to go to the Emergency Room instead of the drug store. Since neither of us was familiar with the area, or where the closest
  hospitals were, we turned around to ask the two police cruisers we had
  just passed.  The officers proceed to take one look at me and insisted
  on calling EMS and having me wait to get checked out. After about 10 minutes a third police cruiser arrived and finally the
  fire truck, and the nice fireman came out and proceeded to ask me more
  questions, quickly insisting that I was way past Benedryl and that I
  needed to go to the hospital - either with my friend or an ambulance.
   I was feeling increasingly worse, and didn't want to wait for the
  ambulance, so I said I wanted to go with my friend.  They let us go on
  the condition that if my breathing got worse, we would immediately
  call 911. Twelve minutes later we arrived at Our Lady of the Lake ER in Baton
  Rouge, where there was no parking, so my friend dropped me off and
  drove around to the other side of the hospital to the parking garage. I checked in, told them I was having trouble breathing, and less than
  five minutes later was back at the front desk asking for a vomit bag
  because I suddenly started having stabbing pains in my stomach and
  felt like I was going to throw up -- I get nauseous often, but RARELY
  actually throw up because of illness. To make the rest of the story short(er), I basically am in the 1% of
  the population that is deathly allergic to (southern) fire ants -- I
  am the 1%... Now, a couple of problems: 1) Allergic reactions to fire ants get increasingly worse each time
  you are bitten. 2) Fire ants are EVERYWHERE, and incredibly hard to avoid.  Pretty
  much a given that I will get bitten a couple times during the course
  of a year, even if I'm careful. 3) Even with my insurance, and the ""discount"" card I found,
  an EpiPen is over $500!  ($527 to be exact, this campaign will be
  raising slightly more because of fees and such). Now, I am working on a long term solution to find more affordable
  EpiPens, but the fact is that I need to have one on hand ASAP -
  especially as in this hot season the ants are out in force!  Grass,
  sidewalks, you name it! This campaign (if you're still reading, after this long ramble) is
  purely to get an Emergency EpiPen Quickly! Please, thank you, and forever grateful for any support, sharing, and

"***Update** We have raised close to $5,500 was raised for our dear elderly
    couple. Family members have assisted the couple in packing up a
    truck and they arrived safely, although in much pain with much need
    of rest, with their family after taking the long route (15 hrs) of
    traveling on the road to Northern Washington state from Utah. However, they are still in need of our assistance. We will not
    quit until the full amount has been raised. We hope that you will
    not quit on them either.  With continuing to make dua for them,
    sharing their story to your family, friends and community and
    assisting financially with their need insha'Allaah we will help
    reach the goal. It will be, at least, 60 days before any services can be put in
    place for them. This includes VA (Veterans Affairs) medical services
    and disability services for the couple. Their family has limited
    resources to care for them until they are able to reestablish some
    of their services. We are still requesting assistance for our dear elders in the following: 1. Because of time constraints, the family is fixing the home and
    having to make minimal repairs. In the meantime the couple will be
    forced to stay at an extended stay hotel at least for the next
    couple weeks because the home will be uninhabitable 2. The cost of fixing the home that no one has resided in for
    years is approximately $2,500+. The couple's family in Washington
    state is also on limited income and only able to financially assist
    minimally until the couple arrives and gets settled in. The home
    needs a new breaker box, a new hot water heater, washer/dryer, stove
    and fan. The walls will need to be repainted. Movers are coming and
    removing all of the previous tenant's furniture, belongings and
    trash that was left behind to make it suitable for our brother and
    sister to live in. 3. Funds to cover the cost of expenses for the couple for a few
    months while they are still recovering. Gas for the vehicle,
    personal items, cooking items, food, etc. 4. Assistance to cover the cost of utilities and expenses in the
    couples current home while they are healing. Cooking/heating oil,
    electric, water, gas, lawn maintenance, etc. Please remember to
    share this post to all who can give. No one in our community should be suffering, especially not our
    elders who need us the most. **************************** There is still a need for this couple and time is running out for
    them. PLEASE COPY, PASTE AND SHARE ON FB, TWITTER AND OTHERS FOR
    THIS ELDERLY COUPLE. We are trying to get their campaign fulfilled
    before it is too late. There is still a pressing need for this couple and time is
    running out for them. The campaign has run for 60 days and our elders are still in need
    of help. The couples lease ends on July 29 2016, with no chance for
    month to month. They will be HOMELESS after the lease ends. The
    couple must be in route to Washington State by at latest July 29th
    with their medical gear, their belongings and themselves to their
    families plot or they will be left in Utah with limitedto no resources. The family is doing all they can to assist the couple. There is
    still a huge gap and there are NO more resources for their needs
    that are unmet. Time has run out for our dear elderly brother and
    sister. Our sister who suffers from cancer and had part of her
    intestines removed, our brother who suffers from heart disease,
    deteriorating spinal disease and neither can work and have limited
    monthly help (with less than $800 a month to live on) from disability. We are asking for at least 600 people to give $1, 5, 10, $20 to
    assist your brother and sister in preventing their homelessness,
    with their disabilities and assisting them to move to their family
    in Washington.  Their family will then care for them through their
    healing and fully into the future. Please share. Please give. Please pray for them. We have found family in a port at the northernmost part of
    Washington state that will assist them upon arriving to Washington
    state, however they are in financial need for the actual move. They are are in need of: 1. Moving van expenses to pack,  move and shuttle
    their bed,  clothing,   personal belongings and medical equipment
    from Utah to Washington State (called in estimates of $3,500-$4500
    with gas and labor from Utah to Washington) 2. Flight expenses for a plane trip across 3
    states, as they are unable to drive for an extended period of time
    (15+ hours) with their conditions. 3. Rental Car to travel for 3 hours from Port
    Angeles to ferry to family's home and for 30 minutes after the ferry 4. Ferry expenses to the area their family lives in. 5. Funds to cover the cost of a couple days too a
    week of hotel stay while the family readies the home (if necessary
    due to time constraints). 6. Because of time constraints, the family is
    fixing the home and having to make minimal repairs. The cost of
    fixing the home that no one has resided in for years is
    approximately $2,500+. The couple's family in Washington state is
    also on limited income and only able to financially assist minimally
    until the couple arrives and gets settled in 7. Funds to cover the cost of expenses for the
    couple for a few months while they are still recovering. Gas for the

    expenses in the couples current home while they are healing.
    Cooking/heating oil, electric, water, gas, lawn maintenance, etc. Please, Please continue to share and encourage others to
      share and give. **********ORIGINAL POST************ Please share and give. There is an elder couple who is in dire need of assistance. They currently need monies for rent, bills, food and assistance
    to fix their car in order to get back and forth to doctors
    appointments for them both. They are on an extremely limited budget
    with only little outside help. Neither the wife or husband are able
    to work. The husband is disabled and has fixed income from disability. He
    had A-fibrillation with a series of 7 electrocardial shocks that did
    not work and led to a dual pacemaker implant which was put in place
    by shutting down the upper and lower chambers of his heart to
    function. He is on a CPAP breathing unit with a heart monitor for
    sleep apnea. In addition, he has a degenerative spine disorder
    called Spondylosis where he is not available to stand, sit, stoop or
    walk for longer than 10 minutes at a time and is currently waiting
    for corrective surgery. The wife just underwent surgery to remove a carcenoid cluster
    from her small intestine, a cancernoid tumor from her mesentery
    which involved a 2 foot removal of the small intestine, had her gall
    bladder removed (cholecystectomy), and 3 biopsied lesions from her
    liver with a pathological report of malignant cancer. She has been
    officially diagnosed with having cancer. She will be sitting with a
    team of oncologists on Tuesday, May 10, 2016 in Utah to determine
    what route to take to treat any future aggressive spread of
    cancerous growth. She suffers from paralysis on her right foot due
    to the L5/S1 disk removed in previous years. Her recent surgery took
    place on April 29th, 2016. She will be under the care of Veteran's
    Administration Hospital and Huntsman's Cancer Institute in Utah
    (University of Utah Health Care Systems). This need is temporary until they qualify for further financial
    stability and they are able to get back on the road to recovery.
    Currently, they are experiencing severe car problems which consist
    of brakes and transmission problems. The brakes on their car are
    paper thin preventing them from driving safely to follow up
    appointments after the surgery. This couple is in extreme need of our help in order to cover
    their needs, at least while the wife heals. She is a US Veteran and
    a full time student. Their family is attempting to assist but unable
    to fully assist their parents, as the income has decreased
    dramatically and their family size has increased. They unfortunately
    cannot fulfill the financial load of the children and their
    household and the parents. The couple are the under care of some of
    the best team of specialists for cancer, heart and spine. So
    traveling or moving is not an option. Now that the wife has had to
    take off of school due to surgery and the diagnosis of cancer, and
    for the future months needed to heal, there is no additional income
    for them, as of yet. Any way you can assist would be greatly
    appreciated. No family in our community should be in need.
    Especially, our elders, should not have to go without. ***NOTE: Please DO NOT HESITATE to contact the moderators
    regarding the couples affairs. We have also attached
    verifications for the couple and the specifics of their bills/needs
    in addition to what I know of their affairs.*** Please join us in praying for the perfect healing of this
    couple. In addition to this, please offer your support for this
    family by sending in what you can to help them financially. The
    family wishes to be private, however I have personally verified
    their information and need, and they have given permission for me to

"My name is Alin Juganaru and this is my story. I have been diagnosed with cancer of unknown primary with cells of
  adenocarcinoma type. This type of cancer likes bone marrow, and it
  stops the production of my red cells. Without red cells, my body can't
  get the oxygen it needs. Blood transfusions may be required to get my
  hemoglobin levels as close as possible to the normal. It is believed that the cancer has originated from the pancreas and
  moved to my spine, hip bone, neck bones, and back of my skull, where
  it has created metastases. The most damaged part is the spine, as one
  of my vertebras, the T11 has collapsed, causing me atrocious pain.
  Fortunately the doctors have done an operation on it and brought it as
  close as possible to its original state and relieved me from the pain.
  Also through proper medication I manage to keep my pain under control. I am undergoing chemotherapy but the treatment is meant to slow down
  the cancerous activity. At this point in time I have been told there
  is no treatment to actually destroy the cancerous cells. All these events have had a huge impact on my life. I haven't
  attended my job since April, and my soul mate, Andreea, also had to
  give up work to look after me. She is giving her very best to see me
  back to our normal life full of love and joy. I have always been a determined person, I won't let the cancer beat
  me. I always stay strong and positive and I will give all my best to
  fight it and win this battle. However this battle is difficult. I have
  all the moral support from my family, my friends and colleagues, I
  have the right nutrition and my doctor is an angel. However, even with all these things, this cancer is a very hard enemy
  to beat, especially because we don't know of any medical treatment to
  destroy it. That is why I am now trying to get in touch with different
  clinics and doctors around the world to make my case known and search
  for a solution to my disease. The truth is I need help in my fight. Nowadays life is governed by
  money, and finances are not in my advantage. Not just for my day to
  day living, but also to pursue my fight to reach that one clinic or
  doctor who can give me the chance to get my life back. So, I send this message to the world, and hope that it will reach
  some warm hearts that will beat for me and help me in my fight.",675,,https://fundrazr.com/b19240,"Cancer does't decide my life, please join my fight",,,
"It began with the question, “Oh my, am I going to die?” When you do not have health insurance personal care gets put on the
  back burner; unless of course there’s an accident or acute condition
  that forces you to see a doctor. For many years we did not have health insurance and the Affordable
  Care Act (ACA) fell short of providing, of all things, affordable
  insurance. It seems we make too much money to qualify for even minimum
  coverage and not enough to afford buying insurance on our own. Fortunately, after a decade of working for her company the new owners
  provided health insurance for my wife Patty. When that happened she
  scheduled a doctor appointment since it had been many years overdue.
  All went well and the doctor asked her to have a mammogram given that
  she was 53 years old at the time and had never had one. It was time.
  It was well past time actually. I am still not covered, but thankfully
  the love of my life is and we were able to move forward with her care
  – to a degree. Not having insurance does that to people; put off health care. Any
  professional health consideration was simply not part of our lives
  until Patty became covered just a few short months ago. The lack of
  money and/or insurance causes people to forego taking care of
  themselves like they know they should. Many illnesses go untreated and
  we simply suffer through them best we can, like so many, too many,
  people do. On February 28th 2014 her first ever mammogram revealed an area of
  concern and on March 3rd a biopsy was taken. There was no history of
  breast cancer in her family yet pathology reported a week later that
  Patty has “cancer;” Invasive Mammary Carcinoma to be exact. I was with
  her at the doctors’ office when we got the news. Prior to finding out about test results we were confident all would
  be well given her family history. We were still quite anxious. But
  when the doctor nervously broke the news we were stunned like a deer
  in the headlights. With ashen faces and wildly beating hearts the
  anguish and initial shock triggered every emotion imaginable and
  instantly overwhelmed us with a kind of dread and fear that I
  sincerely hope you never have to experience. Those three words, “You
  have cancer,” shook us to our very core and suddenly here we are
  starring the “death” question right in the eyes, “Oh my, am I going to die?” After a few minutes assimilating what we had just been told, Patty,
  my rock and the love of my life, cracked for a split second, and then
  she became as stoic as a Viking bravely surveying the battlefield in
  preparation for a battle for her very life. Patty was referred to an Oncologist, who referred her to a breast
  cancer surgeon, who then sent us to a Radiation Oncologist. And
  between all of the doctors were numerous other tests, another
  mammogram, a sonogram, a CT scan, and then blood and other various
  tests. We were shuffled here and there to various medical facilities
  for this and that exam, test, and/or consultation. We experienced little real compassion among all of the medical staff
  we’ve seen. They all, save one or two people, were rather matter of
  factly about what we are facing and have to do to save her life. While
  there is a team of doctors on Patty’s side none of them appear to be
  particularly “team oriented.” It may not be the case, it just seems
  that way. It also feels like each phase of the process so far is
  rather disjointed from the whole. A couple of physicians even told us
  that getting some of Patty’s medical information from a certain
  facility was “like pulling teeth.” Imagine that, we’re in survival mode and one part of the team is
  uncooperative! I swallowed my anger and did what was needed to get the
  information that “they” needed and moved on. I may revisit this issue
  later? People fighting for life from cancer should not have to face an
  uncooperative health care provider. It adds a level of stress and
  extra expense we should not have to endure or emcumber. A lot of time
  and driving long distances costs money we need for other things. On May 12th 2014 Patty had “the surgery” to remove the cancer (tumor)
  along with some lymph nodes. We are currently waiting on pathology to
  determine what stage of cancer we’re facing. Much of the process feels
  like hurry up and wait, with lots of anxiety, lots of it! In the meantime our medical bills are beginning to mount, and they
  are coming from all directions. And we've only just begun the process.
  Add insult to injury we even have to pay to park at one of the
  doctor's offices. Seems like everywhere we turn people are wanting
  money. I know, that's just the way it is. But when you do not have
  much, every dollar we spend for this means we have to short ourselves
  in some other area of our life. And we really do not have that much. Even with health care insurance we are looking at thousands of
  dollars for her treatment and care. At this point we’re certain that
  Patty will require 6 to 8 weeks of radiation treatment. We will not
  know if she will require chemo for about a month from now; about the
  time she starts radiation. She will have to go for radiation
  treatments everyday, except weekends, for up to eight weeks! Since we live some 25 miles, one way, from the radiology center we’ll
  also be spending a lot on fuel, not to mention time off from work and
  other compromises and sacrifices we’ll have to make at who knows what
  cost? This will impact us on every level and every aspect of our
  lives. And right now, without help, there is no way we will ever be
  able to afford it. Here we are, in a battle for life, and right there side-by-side with
  us in this battle is worry about money, occupying the same space as
  mortality - there it is, money - mortality, in the same breath. Can
  you imagine fighting for your very life and you get a call from some
  entity demanding money? It’s demoralizing, demeaning, and emotionally charged to a point of
  spiking our anxiety to a level that people in our country, with a life
  threatening condition, should never, ever, have to bear. No matter, we will do whatever it takes, for how ever long it takes,
  to get through this so that everyone wins, most especially Patty, and
  including those who need to get paid. Almost everyone in our country knows about breast cancer and all of
  the foundations and fundraising efforts for research, development of a
  cure, and big pharma for this type of cancer, but there’s precious
  little money for the actual patient; the one part of this huge medical
  chain that has the weakest link is the patient, my wife Patty. Patty and I recently went to Las Vegas on a business trip for a trade
  show that she attends for her company each year. We saved money for
  months so that I could fly with her on this trip so we could have an
  evening or two of some fun before we embark on Patty’s treatment,
  which began Monday, May 12th with surgery. The picture I posted is the
  two of us after a long day for Patty at the convention. We did enjoy
  ourselves on our first trip together away from home in over 20 years.
  I hope to have many more such times with my precious wife of 33 years. So it’s for this reason that I am asking you, from the bottom of my
  heart, please help me save my precious wife Patty, the love of my
  life, from Breast Cancer. We are of modest means with few resources of our own - basically
  paycheck to paycheck. Please join our battle for her life with a
  donation that will help cure her and help us pay associated expenses. I have no idea how much it will cost to save my precious Patty. The
  figure I posted as a goal was picked as a starting place. It may be
  less or it may be more, I just don't know at this time. Regardless of
  the posted figure we simply need your help. Any amount will be most appreciated. Thank You, R. Scott Ihrig","5,960",of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/elhu7,"Breast Cancer, the weak link, money for patients!",39,,U.S. Dollar
"If you don’t already have the pleasure of knowing Mr. Troy
  Kirwan, let me tell you a little bit about our great friend Troy and
  his family.  I know Troy as kind, considerate, respectful, and funny
  (ok, a lot of his jokes are groaners, but they are still worth it to
  see the smile his face when he tells them!).  I know him as a highly
  accomplished mountain guide, helicopter pilot, stunt man, musician,
  artist, and a man who is very dedicated to his work. Most importantly,
  he is an extremely adoring and supportive father, husband, son,
  brother and uncle. To us, he is a one of kind friend. His 5-year-old daughter Cassidy, and his awesome wife, Sophie,
  make their tight little family of three.  And when surrounded by their
  love and laughter, Troy seems most content. In October of 2013, Troy was diagnosed with ALS. Amyotrophic
  lateral sclerosis, sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly
  progressive, invariably fatal neurological disease that attacks the
  nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. Most people
  with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years
  from the onset of symptoms. However, about 10 percent of those with
  ALS survive for 10 or more years. There is no known cure for ALS. Life as they knew it, was forever changed. As they digested
  what their future might now hold, they began to prepare for the worst
  as best they could.  They graciously, took up their dear friends’
  offer to stay in their basement suite, so they could prepare their
  home in Invermere to sell. Though they have been grateful for the cozy
  apartment and it has been much appreciated, the space is no longer
  suitable and cannot accommodate to the increasing demands of mobility impairment. Upon receiving the diagnosis, Troy’s helicopter pilot
  license was immediately revoked and he had flown his last mission. 
  But, because Troy possesses a multitude of valuable skills and
  abilities that go far beyond flying the helicopter, he was able to
  maintain a position with the company in other capacities for some
  time.  Recently, however, the company has decided to let him go.
  Despite Troy’s willingness and enthusiasm to continue working, at
  present, ultimately, the disease no longer allows him to do so.
  Therefore, the means of income for the family has been exhausted. 
  Troy is a very proud man with a strong will to support and protect his
  family. It is what is most important to him. To make sure they will be
  ok. This family has more obstacles to over come than we can even
  imagine, financial stress is a HUGE one. This is where we can actually
  help and make a difference! Let’s help relieve some of the financial burden that ALS has placed
  on this family while they try to make themselves a place they can call home. Every little bit helps! Troy, Sophie and Cassidy will be so grateful
  for whatever you can do.  Please don't wait to show your support- they
  could really use it now. Thank you for taking the time to read and SHARE this story. Photos below: Top: Troy in Canmore, Jan 2016. Middle: Troy and his daughter, Cassidy. May, 2014.

"Ik weet niet hoe het met jullie zit maar ik kan de
    omstandigheden van bootvluchtelingen niet aanzien. Omdat ik het kan en omdat het nodig is, ga ik actie
    ondernemen! Maar ik heb jullie hulp nodig. Door Saskia Spoor (MD) Als je de laatste tijd het nieuws een beetje gevolgd hebt dan kunnen
  beelden van bootvluchtingen die (mits ze de tocht overleeft hebben) in
  Europa aankomen je niet ontgaan zijn. Veelal hebben ze alles achter
  moeten laten toen ze aan de lange tocht begonnen. Eenmaal aangekomen in Europa zijn de vluchtelingen afhankelijk van
  hulporganisaties of vrijwilligers voor de meest basis medische zorg. Ondanks
  verdragen met Turkije raken de opvangkampen voller en voller en
  krijgen oa kinderen en zwangeren alleen maar de meest basale medische
  hulp terwijl ze vaak veel meer nodig hebben. En dan hebben we het over
  Europa! Niet over donker Afrika. Ik kan daadwerkelijk iets doen aan deze vraag naar medische hulp, aangezien ik als
  tropenarts precies ben opgeleid voor situaties zoals deze. Met andere
  woorden: ik kan 'doktoren waar het echt nodig is'. Helaas zal mijn hulp niets verbeteren aan de politieke situatie of de
  vluchtelingen toestroom, maar ik kan wel directe zorg verlenen aan
  mensen die het daar ter plaatse het meest nodig hebben. Op deze manier
  kan ik hen iets geven waar iedereen recht op heeft: medische hulp. Zoals jullie waarschijnlijk wel van mij weten word je eerder arm dan
  rijk van proberen de wereld te verbeteren, dus ik heb jullie hulp hard
  nodig om vrijwilligerswerk te kunnen doen. Mijn streven is om van 1 september tot 12
  september voor ""Stichting
  Bootvluchteling"" (zie website) op Lesbos te gaan werken.
  Dit betekent dat ik spreekuren ga draaien en diensten ga doen voor
  trauma/spoedeisende hulp en noodopvang. Budget Het budget dat ik nodig heb om de bootvluchtelingen te helpen is als
  volgt opgebouwd: 11 dagen x 10 euro accomodatie = 110 11 dagen x 30 euro auto + eten   = 330 Vliegticket                                     = 500 Onvoorziene zaken                      = 60 ============================== 1000 euro totaal De donaties zijn nodig om het voor mij mogelijk te maken om ter

"In 2005 I was struck by a sudden and devastating mystery illness
  following what appeared to be a flu like episode from which I have
  never recovered . I went form doctor to doctor seeking answers as my
  list of symptoms grew and grew and I  continued to deteriorate . I
  suffered from severe muscle and joint pain , violent shooting and
  stabbing pains would come from nowhere , I felt nauseous nearly all of
  the time and developed food allergies and sensitivities , IBS ,
  colitis ,pelvic pain , bladder dysfunction, interstial cystitis,
  frequent utis and chest infections , hyperthyroidism/Graves disease,
  extreme tachycardia ,very low blood pressure / POTS , tremors , low
  grade fevers , myclonic jerks , and now seizures. My weight plummeted
  from 9 stone to 6 stone 5 pounds . In 2011 after being given no answers by the countless doctors I had
  seen I began to search my symptoms online . DR Google kept telling one
  I had Lyme disease and it was then that I remembered the EM rash which
  is typical of a tick bite I'd had at the beggining of my illness. I was devasted to read that had I known what this meant and my doctor
  had recognised it I could have been treated by just a few weeks of
  antibiotics and made a full recovery .I asked my gp for a blood test
  but it came back negative so they refused to treat me . I wasnt sure
  what to do next having read that the nhs test is unrealiable I sent
  blood to several laboratories in Europe and the USA I waited weeks
  finally they arrived I nearly dropped to my knees after all these
  years of not knowing they all came back with some positive evidence
  that I did indeed have Lyme disease and not only that I had several co
  infections and by this time my immune system had also become
  suppressed. I was diagnosed with Lyme disease and co infections at the
  private clinic. I finally knew what the cause of my deteriorating
  health was so I took my tests to my Gp hoping that I was finally going
  to get the treatment I had needed for over 6 years ,sadly however they
  were disregarded instead they called what I have CFS or M.E .I was
  told my NHS test was negative and that I do not have Lyme and should
  embark on graded excersise but by then I could barely walk. It concerns me that this may cost me like so many others my life .My
  only option for recovery is to seek private treatment which is

"Graag stellen wij ons even voor, wij zijn John Franssen en Peter Westheim en samen hebben wij de
  afgelopen 5 jaar succesvol en met veel plezier een sauna gerunt in het
  zuiden des lands. Helaas is het voor ons niet zinvol om deze sauna voor een tweede
  termijn van 5 jaar te huren omdat de eigenaar van het pand over 5 jaar
  andere plannen heeft met het pand. In deze 5 jaar hebben wij een trouwe klantenkring opgebouwd en graag
  willen wij hen, maar ook u als nieuwe klant, de mogelijkheid bieden om
  samen met ons naar een nieuwe sauna en een nieuw concept te gaan. Een day-spa. Voor onze nieuwe sauna hebben wij een zeer geschikt pand gevonden in
  de nabijheid van Heerlen waar wij een fantastisch nieuw concept op het
  gebied van wellness willen aanbieden voor een zeer vriendelijke prijs.
  In deze wellness omgeving bieden wij een keur aan ontspannende en
  dagvullende behandelingen aan zoals massages, modderbaden,
  kruidenbaden, gezichtsbehandelingen, dr fish en floating baden. Deze
  kunnen aangevuld worden met gebruik van sauna, stoombad of bubbelbad. Wij bieden verschillende sfeervolle relaxruimtes waar men alleen, met
  z'n tweeën of in kleine groepjes kan ontspannen, ontstressen en genieten. Het is echter ook mogelijk om alleen van het sauna gedeelte gebruik
  te maken. Omdat wij niet meerdere verschillende sauna cabines aanbieden en geen
  zwembad hebben kunnen wij de bedrijfskosten (o.a. energie),
  toegangsprijzen en de prijzen voor behandelingen laag houden. Zo
  streven wij ernaar de sauna entree rond € 10,- te kunnen aanbieden. Voor een sfeerimpressie die wij voor ogen hebben verwijzen wij u naar
  onderstaande foto. Om dit te realiseren hebben wij een bedrag van € 15.000,- nodig. Hiervoor vragen wij uw hulp! Bij een inleg van € 100,- ontvangt u een volledig dagarrangement voor
  2 personen incl massage, een hapje en een drankje. Bij het niet halen van het beoogde bedrag storten wij uw bijdrage terug. U kunt meedoen via paypal of rechtstreeks naar rekening nr NL61 INGB

  just how very precious time is. My name is Shari Haynes. I am a young mother of four wonderful
  children and grandmama of four precious grandbabies. I have been
  battling breast cancer since March 18, 2013. In October of 2014 I
  found out that the breast cancer had metastasized in to my bones.
  Stage 4, terminal, and incurable. Let's try different treatments and
  medications in hopes it won't spread until all options are exhausted.
  I will be fighting the cancer demon for the rest of my life. I am
  exhausted. I need to find a way to get the rest that I need, pay my
  medical bills, feed and support my family. I desperately want to live
  as many years as possible. I want to see my 8yr old son graduate high
  school and watch my grandbabies grow up. Please help. I need your prayers and financial support to keep up the
  fight. To win the fight. To live. In March of 2013 I went to the Dr for a disformation in my left
  breast. His was an expression of immediate alarm. I was hurriedly
  referred for a mammogram and ultrasound. He then proceeded to gather
  the entire cancer history of my family. By March 18th I'd had four
  breast exams, two mammograms, three ultrasounds, and a vacuum-assisted
  core biopsy. Waiting for the pathology results felt like a lifetime. At the age of 37 I was diagnosed with stage 3C invasive ductal
  carcinoma. I had breast cancer. With a prayer in my heart my mind
  reeled. How could this be? How would I tell my children? I didn't have
  time for cancer! I had too many important moments that I wanted to be
  a part of. I had a 6 yr old son who depended on me. He would start
  kindergarten soon. My grandson would turn one in April. My youngest
  daughter's graduation ceremony was coming up in May. A granddaughter
  was due to be born in July. I had just started a new job 6 months
  prior. I had to stand strong. I had to win. I had to live! My life and the lives of my family were changed forever that day. Life became a whirlwind of Dr's, scans, surgeons; all while juggling
  family, work, and home. During my initial visit with the surgeon
  another ultrasound was done. This one showed tumor areas in the shape
  of the devils head with horns. My husband exclaimed “Is that the
  devil?!” We all stared in surprise. The surgeon replied “Cancer sure
  is evil. That's for sure.” Surgery was scheduled. The night before my surgery I was given a spiritual blessing that
  said I would be surrounded by family members who had already passed
  supporting me from the other side. On April 1, 2013 I underwent a full
  left mastectomy. Could it be an April fool’s joke? Please... When I
  was waking from the anesthesia the first thing I said was “I’m going
  to kick cancer's ass!” A few minutes later In another waking moment I
  said that my 2nd great grandmother, Mary Bommeli Eyring, was in the
  room with us and pointed to where she was standing. A few months
  earlier I had been overcome with a need to read stories about my
  ancestors. I was drawn to her story particularly. This was my first
  realization of just how important genealogy and family history is.
  It’s so much more than names and dates. It is your family's stories
  and personalities. They are very real lives that were once lived. If I
  hadn’t been reading Mary’s histories I would have known a spirit was
  with me but would not have recognized who she was. The surgery revealed two larger tumors with tiny tumors independently
  speckled all around outside the larger tumors. Of 32 lymph nodes
  removed 20 had tumors. This meant an all too real risk that it could
  have spread to other lymph nodes throughout my body. Only time would tell. May 1, 2013 I started chemotherapy. Along with the normal effects
  (chemo-brain, fatigue, nausea, soreness, taste changes, etc…) I
  encountered severe rashes, bone aches, neuropathy, and vision changes.
  I forced myself to keep looking forward. There were times I wanted to
  just lie down and submit to the discomfort but there was a voice
  inside me that said “No way! Get up and get moving!” The second and
  fourth day after a treatment were spent writing, printing, cutting
  out, and laminating bookmarks with encouraging messages to take to
  others at my next chemo visit. This kept me occupied from feeling
  defeated. The third day I was rarely able to lift my head from the
  pillow. On August 9, 2013 I went in for my last treatment adorned in a
  rash that even covered my eyelids and numb and tingling hands and
  feet. The Oncologist presented the choice to skip this last treatment.
  I knew I needed to do all I could to beat this monster called cancer
  so I said no way, I’ve come this far, I’m finishing this. Under the
  Lord’s wing I made it through and rang the bell of completion with
  great relief. For a moment I could breathe again. One week later I started my work up visits for radiation. This is
  done in different stages to determine the depth and measurements for
  the radiation. You're marked with small permanent tattoo dots placed
  for reference points. Not exactly what I planned on my first tattoo
  being. This process spans over multiple visits in three week’s time.
  On Tuesday September 3, 2013 I began radiation. The treatments were
  five days a week on my way to work every morning. I experienced
  weakness, fatigue, and severe burns; the likes of which I’ve never
  felt before. Because of the severity of the bone soreness I was sent
  for a full body bone scan. This would help determine if the cancer had
  moved in to the bone. With much relief it was determined that I had
  somehow fractured my rib, had stressed the rib joints, and dislocated
  my collarbone while coughing which then very painfully popped itself
  back in to place. But I didn't have bone cancer! Or so I thought.
  Again, under the Lord’s gracious protection I made it through 28
  treatments. On October 10, 2013 I received my radiation ‘diploma’. I
  would irradiate from the inside out for 10 more days then the burns
  could begin to heal! Yay! Throughout this journey I have continued to work as many hours as I
  could possibly handle to support my family. My husband had lost his
  job in January 2013 and while we desperately needed the income, I more
  desperately needed someone to take care of me, the kids, the errands,
  and home. The bills ominously piled up. We fell behind in every way. I’ve had many misconceptions of how this journey would be. I expected
  to lose weight during chemo and to not have to shave my legs for the
  entire summer grasping at every bright side I could find.
  Unfortunately, the steroids and hormones caused lots of weight gain
  and the hair loss was not painless or quick. My body hair rebelled for
  as long as it could and attempted over and over to regrow. The hair on
  my head did not just fall out. It could be pulled out with your
  fingers but didn’t want to fall out for some reason. Showering was a
  horrible mess. Soon it was so uncomfortable that I just took duct tape
  and rolled it over my head over and over until the hair was removed.
  But nothing prepared me for the empty way I’d feel when my eyebrows
  and eyelashes finally fell out, the humiliation I would feel when my
  fingernails and toenails turned black, the lopsided way I’d feel when
  trying to dress missing one breast, or the stare of kids and adults
  alike when I'd go in public. Four weeks later I started the hormone blocker and could finally
  begin recovery... I thought. I was left with constant fatigue and soreness. My arms and hands
  periodically go numb. I expected that after a few weeks of completing
  treatment I’d begin to feel better. This was a very unreal expectation. I found out last month that the breast cancer has metastasized into
  my bones. I will now fight cancer for the rest of my earthly days. My
  right femural neck is almost completely taken over. I have been in a
  wheelchair ever since because of the high risk of fracture with any
  weight baring and the severe bone pain. I began radiation again on
  November 10, 2014. I am scheduled for a partial hip replacement
  surgery on Wednesday November 26, 2014. I will spend Thanksgiving in
  the hospital. The fatigue is overwhelming. I am exhausted. I NEED to find a way to
  put some focus on resting and enjoying life before it’s too late. I
  need your help. I cannot do this alone. I am a survivor but my journey
  is far from over. I truly believe that our experiences are so often about how we
  respond to them. The people watching our journey and going through it
  with us learn as much as we do. I want my kids and family to be proud
  of how I fought and faced this battle. I want them to feel inspired
  and filled with hope when they face their own troubles in this life.
  It's so important to extend faith, compassion, caring, and the light
  of Christ even during times of great hardship. I have dedicated my life to serving others and caring for my family.
  It's very hard for me to stop and realize that I have to put some care
  into myself so that I can continue to be here for my family. We have two cars in need of major repairs. We do not have
  reliable transportation. This is especially a hardship when I need to
  get to and from the Huntsman in Salt Lake City from Springville. I
  never know if I will make it from point A to point B safely. But they
  are my family's only means of transportation. Along with the
  tremendous medical bills we have fallen behind on everyday bills and
  expenses. My husband is working now and I work as many hours as
  possible - Missing many hours for Dr appointments and surgeries. But
  it's just not enough. We cannot do this alone. To make a donation click the 'Contribute' button. If you would like

  their life. Their son Justin, now 27. Justin was married to an amazing
  woman 2 years ago, who then became the mother of their new baby girl
  last year. His life has only just begun. But now Justin is faced with
  a word he never thought he would hear. CANCER. He was diagnosed with a
  form of cancer he was not aware that he was at high risk for because
  he was adopted. He had no way of knowing the medical history of his
  biological family. He is now in stage 3 of the cancer, where it has
  started spreading to his lymph nodes. He will need to complete
  chemotherapy, radiation and likely surgery. They are already feeling
  the stress of the medical bills and with the time he will need to take
  off of work, this is a huge burden on him and his family. He needs to
  focus on surviving and beating this cancer so that he can live the
  life he deserves with his wife Doral, and amazing daughter, Taylor.

"History Y oga It Up ( www.yogaitup.ca ) was developed by
  myself, Julia Johnson Baker, on the foundation of a lifelong passion
  for creative expression, healthy living, something a little magical,
  and to make a difference in children's lives. I am a Certified
  Children's Yoga Teacher and hold a Masters in Development Studies
  alongside being a mom of two kids, an active member of the Girl Guides
  of Canada, and a supportive member of my local community. I am a
  person who has been dedicated to preventative health education with
  children and families for over 20 years, managing both local and
  international projects with a variety of organizations within Canada
  and abroad. I have worked extensively with different communities and
  school districts, as well as privately with children and families. I believe yoga goes beyond the traditional thoughts of poses and
  meditation. I came to yoga as a teen in need of support for anxiety
  and depression and as such strongly value what yoga can offer to
  children and youth. It is a tool that can foster positive attitudes,
  healthy body awareness, respect for self and others, strength in
  relationships, and the focus to succeed in any goal. What We Do Y oga It Up! provides unique programming to children, their families and their
    schools that utilizes tools from the fields of social-emotional
    learning, mindfulness, positive psychology and asset-based
    development alongside yoga in order to develop emotional, mental and physical health. Through practice, the aim is to be able to provide children and
    youth with the ability to utilize skills they learn on their yoga
    mat within their every day life. Programs are geared
    towards assisting children in the areas of: o Anxiety and Stress o Self-Worth o Healthy Habits o Depression o Self-Regulation o Anti-Bullying Strategies o Grief o Goal Setting and Focus o Body Image o Kindness Why We Need You For Schools: The heart of Yoga It Up resides in its school program. This is a
    B.C. curriculum-based program that focuses on providing an affordable option for schools that
    supports the development of compassion for the self, as well as
    others, in order to support and increase: Social & Emotional
    Learning, Self-Regulation of Emotions, Mindfulness-Based Practices,
    Physical Education, Anti-Bullying Strategies and Feelings of
    Self-Worth. The school program aims to develop Personal and Social
    Core Competencies in students. The problem? Our programming is supported by the school, or families
  of the school, and in many instances the schools most in need of our
  programming are located in less fortunate communities. To date, Yoga
  It Up has provided many reduced and no-cost opportunities in school
  districts throughout the Lower Mainland, however, this is simply not a
  sustainable model for us and we need your help in order to continue
  our efforts! For Families: Further to the school program we
  offer our “Peaceful Warriors” community yoga classes for ages
  preschool to teen through both group and private session options.
  These are currently offered in Vancouver, Delta, Surrey and Richmond.
  The majority of our families have come to us with children who are
  challenged with anxiety and/or other mental and emotional health needs. The problem? These families are often accessing other
    modalities, such as psychotherapy, occupational therapy, behavioral
    intervention, (etc.) to assist their child’s needs, and as such, are
    often stretched financially. For some families our classes are the
    only programming they can get their child to attend willingly! The
    problem is that yoga as a form of therapy is yet to be recognized by
    most third party funders and as such our families are left with
    difficult decisions and financial strain. Again, Yoga It Up has provided many reduced and no-cost opportunities
    for students in financial need, however, this is simply not a
    sustainable model for us and we need your help in order to continue
    our efforts! Where Will Your Money Go As an example of our programming costs… School Program: 1) 5-week Program Model for a medium-sized school (approximately
    10 classes of 25 students each; 5 sessions per class): $2500 Approx. cost per student: $10 total for 5 classes (that’s $2 per class!) 2) 10-week Program Model for a medium-sized school
    (approximately 10 classes of 25 students each; 10 sessions per
    class): $5000 Approx. cost per student: $20 total for 5 classes (that’s $2 per class!) 3) Weekly Programming Option for a medium-sized school
    (approximately 10 classes of 25 students each; 1 class each per week
    36 weeks): Approx. $16,000 (that’s $64 per student for the entire
    school year!) Peaceful Warriors Community-Based Programming: 1) Group classes for one term (approx. 10 weeks in length): $250 2) Group classes for the year (approx. 45 weeks worth): $1125 3) Private classes for a child with special needs (monthly):
    $200 - $400 (depending on length of session) 4) Private classes for a child with special needs (yearly):
    $2200 - $4400 (depending on length of session) Practice is Progress and as such we advocate for consistent programming! The more
    time you have to practice a new healthy habit, the more it becomes a
    natural reflex to root and breathe your way through challenging
    emotions or situations vs want to run away or fight. Help us create
    Peaceful Warriors in children & youth!! Do you have a particular school or student you would like to
    fund? Let us know and we will make it happen! For more information on who we are and what we offer please visit our

"** Flash Fundraiser ** Deanna Toner, 22 and Joseph Brandt, 32 of Saginaw, Michigan felt
  blessed to be adding a new baby to their young family.  Deanna’s
  pregnancy seemed to be progressing normally when they went in for
  their routine 20-week ultrasound. Like many parents, they were excited
  to find out whether they were expecting a boy or girl but during the
  test, that also evaluates the baby's anatomy and checks for any
  abnormalities , the ultrasound technologist grew silent.  After
  the exam, she told Deanna and Joseph she could not see the left
  portion of their son’s heart and referred them to a specialist for a
  closer look. After many follow-up tests, they found out their
    unborn son Derrick had a rare heart condition called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. They were shocked and heartbroken. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome or HLHS is a serious problem that
  involves several parts of the left side of the heart. They were told
  that the left side of his heart stopped developing very early on in
  the womb, and as a result, the right side had grown larger to
  compensate. They were referred to The University of Michigan C.S. Mott
    Children’s Hospital to get the specialized care Derrick would
  need. The doctors at U of M are top in their field and told Deanna and
  Joseph their son would need three open-heart surgeries before he turns
  2 to correct this issue. On September 4th, 2016 Deanna was induced, and at 7:35 am gave birth
  to Derrick Andrew Brandt. He was 8lbs 7oz. and 20 1/2 inches. Derrick
  was placed on Deanna’s chest immediately after birth but was
  struggling to breathe, and very purple, although he was crying. After
  only a few minutes, doctors took him to the NICU where they gave him
  oxygen, placed an IV in his umbilical cord and began to give him
  prostaglandins to keep his heart working so he could survive until
  surgery. The next day, Derrick was transferred to the PCTU (pediatric
  cardiology thoracic unit) because he kept ""forgetting to
  breathe"" and his heart rate had dropped below the acceptable
  range of 100bpm. Thankfully, Derrick seemed to correct himself on both
  issues with only minimal intervention. Over the next few days, he
  continued to improve, and he was cleared for his first open heart surgery. On Friday, September 9th, before he was even a week old,
    Derrick underwent the first of his three expected surgeries, a
    Norwood operation, which is the most complex and highest risk
    procedure in the sequence of staged reconstruction for
  HLHS. It was a 4-6 hour procedure, and Derrick did very
  well!  He is a true fighter, and his U of M team of specialists are
  very pleased with his prognosis moving forward.  He will remain in the
  hospital for roughly four more weeks and then return to Ann Arbor for
  frequent follow-up appointments, a 200 mile round trip. Even though they tried to plan in advance, the extended time in the
  hospital is putting a huge financial strain on Derrick’s parents, who
  are both on the kitchen staff at the Saginaw Country Club. Deanna is
  on maternity leave for a few more weeks, but after almost two weeks
  off, Joseph has had to return to work.  Club management has been very
  supportive, guaranteeing Deanna a job when she can come back. But
  Deanna is uncertain when that will be and understandably leery of
  sending Derrick to daycare. Their families have been super helpful,
  taking care of two-year-old old Joseph and four-year-old Brookelynn,
  but other arrangements will soon need to be made . The overall stress of being 100 miles away from home, unable to work
  and praying for her new baby is overwhelming for Deanna. After reading Derrick's amazing story, Ride to Give has offered our support. We know
    a Flash Fundraiser could help ease Deanna and Joseph’s burden and
    allow them to be more present for Derrick while he heals. Please help us give the gift of peace of mind by making a

  is a chronic condition that is both debilitating and life changing.
   With widespread pain that affects every nerve, tendon and muscle.
  There is not a minute of any day that I am totally pain free despite
  many medications and gentle exercise. I am not alone, with approx 70

   Together with other groups (all voluntary), we are working endlessly

"For those of you who have taken the time to read this page, thank you. Also, if you are not following Amy or Derek on Facebook, here is a little bit of their story so far... Dexter Green was born on September 25, 2012 to parents Derek & Amy, & sister Bayleigh. After birth, Dexter was diagnosed with Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia. His stomach, intestines, kidney & spleen were in his left chest cavity, squishing his left lung to a quarter of its normal size. The day after his birth, he was air lifted from Medicine Hat to Calgary to the Alberta Children's Hospital. In Calgary, he underwent a five hour long, life-saving surgery when he was only two days old. For the first three & a half months of life, Dexter was on high flow oxygen. He remained in hospital until mid-January, when he was finally able to go home on a weekend pass. A few days later, discharged! The joy of having their newest family member at home was short lived. Although Dexter has been tube feb since birth, he has had constant issues with reflux. His weight dropped down into the third percentile, & as a result he was readmitted to hospital for another surgery. On February 13th, Dexter's complicated (due to his unique anatomy) GJ tube placement surgery was performed. The surgery was a first for Calgary's Alberta Children's Hospital, & it was a success! A week later, the Greens were headed back home to Medicine Hat... & Dexter was back in the hospital two weeks later with pneumonia & a collapsed lung. Ever since Dexter's last hospital visit, his old problems with reflux, previously ""fixed"" for three weeks after the initial GJ tube surgery, reemerged. The reflux is quite painful, it is frequent, & the doctors in Alberta do not have a solution. This week, the Greens will be getting news regarding a possible trip/admission to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario. In the meantime, the Greens are dealing with the financial burdens associated with having a child in & out of hospital: the four months of work that Derek missed so that he could be in Calgary with his family; the lack of respite funding; the worry of Amy's paid maternity leave ending next month (due to complications during pregnancy, Amy was forced to take an early leave); the stress of unfunded & frequent bi-weekly/monthly trips to see specialists in Calgary's Alberta Children's Hospital for essential procedures. This family is doing everything that they can to pay the bills. They have sold many of their personal valuables, including their wedding bands & engagement rings, to make ends meet. Many of you who are currently reading this have opened your hearts to this family, have supported them at the steak night in December. Unfortunately, CDH patients & their families have a long road of recovery ahead of them, filled with steps forward, setbacks & surgeries.

"Patrick's Story My cousin and his wife, Brian and Lessie Wethington, recently found
  that their baby boy, Patrick, may have the same mitochondrial disease
  that their first son Daniel had.  Sadly, this condition took Daniel's
  life two years ago. There is hope!  Advancements in safer diagnosis and treatment methods
  have been made in the last couple of years.  The family is upbeat that
  these efforts will have a postive impact to Patrick's health and keep
  this disease at bay.  However, they received word from their insurance
  that the genome testing that Patrick needs is not covered.  As you can
  guess, this testing is expensive and the family is going to need
  financial help. Most of us will never have to face this challenge as our children
  have grown or will grow to have long fulfilling lives.  Brian and his
  family are confronting this dilemma twice! Please carefully consider providing
    any financial aid you can afford to help cover the medical expenses
    that will accumulate.  Your donations are greatly appreciated and

"Two years old, Igor was born in Poland with a congenital
    abnormality that resulted in severe brain damage. His family does
    their best to care for him (Mom had to quit her job), but a few
    pieces of basic equipment would make a HUGE difference in their
    daily lives. Are you able to help? THE WHOLE STORY: Born in Poland on January 19, 2013, Igor Sakowicz and his
    family have suffered immensely from the earliest moments of his life. Due to a congenital abnormality called cortical dysplasia,
    Igor has a severe and uncontrollable form of epilepsy which has
    caused prolonged and frequent seizures since he was a newborn.
    Depriving him of oxygen, the seizures (as many as xx per day) have
    severely damaged Igor’s brain, leaving him blind and lacking in
    muscle tone to do even the most basic functions (he can’t even hold
    his bottle). He has never interacted with people, including his
    parents, Iwona and Kamil. Sadly, there is no hope of Igor recovering brain function, but
    his family’s goal is to do whatever they can to keep him
    comfortable, pain-free, and improve his baseline condition through
    physical therapy sessions 5-days/week. His mother quit her job in
    order to care for him, and his father’s ability to work has also
    been affected. The realistic expectations for Igor’s quality of life are
    very low, but even the tiniest improvement helps ease the strain of
    his care. Now, at the age of two, after intensive and ongoing
    physical therapy since infancy, Igor can roll himself over. This
    achievement allows his parents to move him more easily -- Igor is 45
    pounds of slack weight and swollen from steroid use -- which has
    become an increasing physical challenge. How can you help? Poland has socialized medical insurance, but it only covers
    only a small amount of what Igor needs in terms of theraputic
    treatments and equipment. We ask your help in raising the funds to
    provide a key piece of equipment – a booster car seat designed
    specifically for children with special needs – which would make life
    a lot easier and significantly lessen the daily struggles that the
    Sakowicz family endures. Every little bit helps, and we sincerely
    thank you for caring. Any additional funds raised will be used for
    Igor’s physical therapy.","1,720",of $2k goal,https://fundrazr.com/ftqW1,Igor has Special Needs,20,,U.S. Dollar
"I'm Daniel Phillips & I live in Florence, AL. It is with great
  humility that I write asking for help. My diseases are all invisible.
  I'm lucky in one area, if you call it luck: I don't look as sick as I
  am. It isn't lucky, because it's deceiving because I look well &
  it makes getting approved for financial help difficult if not almost
  impossible it seems. I have major diseases & health challenges and
  I'm asking for your financial help please if you can. Thank you so
  much in advance. Here are my health challenges: Type 1 diabetes, hypertension, autoimmune hypothyroidism,
  hypogonadism, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, diabetic hand
  syndrome, benign tumor left adrenal gland, chronic dry
  eye-keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), irritable bowel syndrome,
  gastroparesis, obstructive sleep apnea, migraine headaches, chronic
  tension type headaches, tachycardia, bell's palsy, trigeminal
  neuralgia, orthostatic hypotension, vitamin D deficiency, chronic
  fatigue syndrome, ongoing hypokalemia/low potassium, occipital
  neuralgia, and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. Recently, I've
  had issues from dysautonomia-orthostatic tachycardia, discovered when
  I had problems with lightheadedness & dizziness when standing up
  or changing positions. Because of that condition, POTS, postural
  orthotatic tachycardia syndrome, I am heat intolerant and in need of a
  cooling vest for outside. My financial needs are way beyond that and
  immediate, needed to pay co-pays of prescription medications. Also, I
  have co-pays for insulin pump supplies, diabetes testing supplies, and
  continuous monitoring supplies and some noncovered by insurance
  supplies---also, outstanding bill for autonomic testing that insurance
  won't cover that I had done at Vanderbilt Hospital. Please, if there
  is the least amount of help, I send my gratitude to you. I have worked
  all my life, full-time, but, this terrible process began at the end of
  2011 and I've used all of my own resources. It is a long process to
  try and get the financial help that you need and the wheels turn
  slowly. I'm exhausted physically, mentally, and emotionally, but, I
  won't give up my fight. This campaign is for myself, Daniel Phillips,
  Florence, Alabama. I will state again, all funds will be used for my
  medications (co-pays) and insulin pump supplies (co-pays) and for
  out-of-pocket costs that insurance doesn't cover for my recent
  autonomic dysfunction testing and Vanderbilt University in Nashville,
  TN, and for a cooling vest (so that I can go outside).....thank you so
  much. Also, the money will be used to pay for my private insurance
  BCBS of Alabama premium until I get disability coverage. My HOPE &
  MY FIGHT is to WORK AGAIN and that will be in writing. I am writing
  lines on the few days when I feel like it now & have made great
  progress over the past 5 years, one sentence at a time. My work will
  be a book of inspiration that I hope helps many by me sharing my
  lessons learned of how illness makes you the best version of yourself
  & gives you the opportunity to thrive in life-yes, it is true. I
  believe we have a choice as to how to react to our circumstances and I
  choose to be happy and do something useful to hopefully share what I
  think I learned by making my mistakes that will help others. With
  that, I want you to know that for now, I am in a struggle & need
  help if you are able. I also want you to know that I am actively
  pushing myself & doing my part the best I can to move forward
  taking care of myself. If you have any questions that I can address

"Emily Rose Nelson is gorgeous, sweet, little girl who was dealt a lot of medical issues.  She's had most of them since birth, but did a GREAT job hiding them from us and compensating for them all on her own.  Although she was born with a Congenital Brain Abnormality (a missing Septum Pellucidum that helps connect the left brain and right brain), enlarged ventricles, and Hydrocephalus (excess fluid in her brain), she was able to compensate just enough to get by.  Instead of finding the birth issues she was misdiagnosed with ADHD.  Now that she is almost 12 years old things are changing.  The fluid has become extensive and most likely needs to be shunted (re-routed with a device that is implanted using a tube to re-route the fluid to another part of the body).  She had a pretty massive seizure ON AN AIRPLANE and has since been also diagnosed with Epilepsy (seizure disorder) and Cerebral Palsy (Developmental Disorder).  However, since we financially couldn't afford insurance we had to let it go back in April.  Now the Hospital that we were using doesn't want to work with us on her billing so she can get a much needed MRI to prove the theory behind the fluid causing pressure, which is causing headaches and seizures.  Some really caring people asked that they be able to donate to Emm's medical care, and suggested a PayPal sponsored outlet for convenience.  To all of you, whether we've ever met or not, you are Blessings from God.  Your hearts are bigger than I can imagine.  Take care, we love you all!9-19-11:  Emily received her MRI today and it will be reviewed by the Neurosurgeon first thing Wednesday morning. However, the Radiologist that went over the scan with us stated that it did ""appear"" that there is a bit more fluid on her brain now that back in July. It appears to be ""restricted"" from flowing down into the 3rd and 4th ventricles...causing the enlargement of 1 and 2, and the excessive fluid there. This, however, is still an early ""theory"" and soon we will know more. Stay tuned...9-20-11:  New term that came from the Radiology report today - ""Cerebral Aqueduct stenosis"".  Definition:  ""Aqueductal stenosis is a common cause of obstructive (non-communicating) hydrocephalus. The cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius) is a narrow channel that connects two of the ventricles (fluid-filled chambers within the brain) and passes through the midbrain. Normal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics require an open aqueduct so that fluid can flow freely through this area. If the aqueduct is blocked, this is called stenosis and can lead to the symptoms of hydrocephalus.""  We meet with the Neurosurgeon at 9am tomorrow to find out where to go from here!  God help me...I no longer know what to hope for...other than her safety!9-21-11-We met with the Neurosurgeon this morning.  We have a surgery appointment for 9/29/11 at 8am.  The first procedure they will do is called a ""Endoscopic 3rd Ventriculostomy"".    This is described as:  ""In endoscopic third ventriculostomy, a small perforation is made in the thinned floor of the third ventricle, allowing movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) out of the blocked ventricular system and into the interpenducular cistern (a normal CSF space). Cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricle is thus diverted elsewhere in an attempt to bypass an obstruction in the aqueduct of Sylvius and thereby relieve pressure. The objective of this procedure, called an “intracranial CSF diversion,” is to normalize pressure on the brain without using a shunt. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy is not a cure for hydrocephalus, but rather an alternate treatment.""  If this doesn't successfully relieve the pressure from the fluid...which has indeed increased in just the last 6 weeks...then they will go right back in and put in a Shunt.  We are hopeful that the first procedure works to avoid the future of living with the Shunt...however, either procedure will bring my baby relief...and ultimately that is our goal.  We want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your love and support.  Please keep the prayers and good thoughts coming.  9-26-11:  Hey everyone, just wanted to let you know that the date of surgery has been changed from September 29th to October 6th, for various reasons.  It will not, however, change again.  The surgeon was ""comfortable"" with the one week delay, but was definitely NOT comfortable with any longer than that.  There is a good possibility that Aetna has accepted us and hopefully (keep your fingers crossed) we will have some insurance coverage in place by the first.  Emm's surgery went EXCEPTIONALLY well Thursday.  We were delayed by 3 and half hours, but that couldn't be helped.  The surgery itself only took about an hour and Dr. Bristol came out immediately to tell us that her brain responded beautifully to the procedure.  The fluid started flowing out of its ""prison"" immediately, hopefully never to return!  We were able to bring her home Friday at around 8pm!

"From Quebec to Utah: Please help Eileen get a bone marrow transplant Eileen Simmons in Idaho needs a bone marrow

  Anna May Kinney, who has advanced cancer. It is urgent that he goes
  NOW to Eileen’s hospital in Salt Lake City to give the bone marrow
  donation while Anna May is in hospital, and before her condition worsens. Eileen’s daughter Janet explains that Eileen “has myelofibrosis which
  is a very rare form of bone marrow cancer in which the marrow turns to
  scar tissue.” Her medical team has tried different strategies, but,
  Janet writes, “she has had bad reactions to blood products and to her
  chemotherapy so it is no longer worth the risk, and her only real hope
  is the bone marrow transplant.” She wrote to John, “You are her only real chance of recovering from
  this before it becomes acute leukemia which would only give her a few
  months to live. I appreciate your willingness to donate since it can
  save her life and improve her quality of life. Right now she currently
  suffers from excruciating pain in the bones, fatigue, anemia,
  enlargement of her spleen, and several other issues.” John is caught between caring for his partner and his sister, and

"Our animal loving, adventure finding, truth seeking, tree hugging,
  wild spirited, independent and no-end-to-the-laughs friend, Bonice
  needs our help. At the end of November 2014 symptoms arose that didn't
  seem like anything to worry about, but we know now, were the first
  signs of cancer. And it's the really aggressive kind. In just 8 weeks
  it's progressed into her lymph nodes and her chest and is quite
  painful. After some final test results, it was confirmed that she has
  stage 3C breast cancer early in 2015. We rallied together as her community of friends and family to help
  her with the sudden change of course and uncertainty. At the time she
  entered early treatment and shifted into an unexpected and high speed
  ride into the world of medicine and a battle with cancer. She started
  chemotherapy and a prescribed treatment program that would aim to
  'eradicate' the cancer and go as far as invasive surgery if the
  chemotherapy and radiation did not work. After a few months of
  treatment there was not a noticeable improvement to the size of her
  tumor, but an incredible change to her quality of living and general
  feeling of wellness. At the crossroads of choosing to enter a more
  aggressive program that would not be a guarantee of 'beating it' or to
  choose an alternative route to healing that had the potential of
  living and not just surviving she chose the latter. She's continued to live on the Sunshine Coast and adopeted a dog
  recently that she credits with saving her life. She's been pursing
  alternative methods of treatment including traditional and herbal
  medicines, guidance from a naturopathic oncologist and daily
  meditation. For the most part she's been able to maintain her
  independence and quality of life she wanted to. However, recent tests have shown that the tumor has grown, so she is
  considering different options, which will include a move to Vancouver
  to be closer to medical care. It's possible she may re-enter
  conventional treatment depending on outcome of further testing, but
  either way she needs to be closer to the support she needs. Costs
  associated with the move including increased cost of living and
  possible medical costs are a burden that we'd like to lessen. If you know Bonice, you know she wouldn't ask for this kind of help
  so we are doing it for her (with her consent, of course). Donations of
  any amount are welcome and greatly appreciated. If you aren't able to
  donate at this time, we understand. Regardless, please please pass
  this on to anyone who might know Bonice and be able to help. And
  please keep her in your hearts and prayers. If you would prefer to make payment offline you can send her a direct
  email transfer at boniceharrietthomas@gmail.com. If you are in the
  Vancouver area and able to support or contribute in another way or
  capacity please email Kim Haxton at k imihaxton@gmail.com . If you have

"On Sunday, September 25th, 10 members of Team Ride to Give
    will participate in Ironman Chattanooga on behalf of 14-year-old
    Cheyanna Edmondson who is currently battling Ewing's sarcoma.
     Bellow is her story... 14 years ago, Sherry and Spud Edmondson of Charleston, TN were
  blessed when Sherry gave birth to twins Joshua and Cheyanna, join two
  older brothers from Sherry’s previous marriage. They are a very humble
  and gracious family, who love spending time together, being outdoors,
  and rooting for the University of Alabama. Over the years, the
  Edmondsons have faced many challenges like any family, but none like
  the one they are facing now, fighting back against childhood cancer. In the spring of 2016, Cheyanna took a hard fall. She was walking on
  some rocks by a creek when her foot slipped, and she took a tumble
  that left her banged up and bruised. At the time of her accident she
  was checked out by the pediatrician and all looked fine. Three months
  later, Cheyanna was still having pain in her lower back and hip and
  frequent headaches. She returned to the pediatrician who treated her
  for a pulled muscle. Unfortunately, Cheyanna continued to be in
  constant pain, so she went back to the pediatrician several times, but
  received no real answers. When her parents notice knots had formed on
  Cheyanna's head, Sherry took her back to the doctor and insisted on an
  MRI of her pelvic area and her skull. Her mother’s intuition was
  screaming there was something more going on with Cheyanna, and she was
  insistent on further testing. As soon as her doctor saw the MRI they sent the Edmondsons directly
  to the pediatric oncology department of Children's Hospital at
  Erlanger in Chattanooga, the longest 45-minute drive of their
  lives. After more testing that included a biopsy on August
    29th, it was discovered that Cheyanna was suffering from an
    extremely rare bone cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma . Her parents we
  completely heartbroken by the shocking news their daughter had cancer. Ewing’s is a primary bone cancer that affects mainly children and
  adolescents. There are approximately 200 new cases of Ewing's sarcoma
  diagnosed in the United States annually which account for only 1% of
  all childhood cancers. Ewing tumors that grow in bone like Cheyanna’s
  are typically found in the long bones of the legs and arms, or bones
  in the chest, trunk, pelvis, back, or head. A tumor that has spread
  can cause a child to feel very tired and to lose weight. If it has
  spread to the lungs, it can also cause breathlessness. Tumors near the
  spine can cause unexplained weakness or even paralysis. Because many
  illnesses can cause the same symptoms as Ewing's sarcoma, it's
  sometimes missed in its early stages. Looking back now, Sherry can see
  signs where Cheyanna was tired frequently long before she fell as well
  as other small changes, but she had no idea that the sleepiness and
  chronic pain her daughter had been experiencing was cancer. Because of the aggressive treatment needed for Ewing’s, Cheyanna has
  had to remain in the hospital. Cheyanna has only been home twice since
  the end of August and just for a few days each time, but it was enough
  to lift her spirits. She is currently at the beginning of a
    12-week cycle of chemotherapy which will keep her in Chattanooga
    most of the next three months. Following this cycle,
  Cheyanna will have another MRI and after reading the results, her
  doctors will decide whether to do radiation or take another path. That
  is all the Edmondsons know for now, but they continue to lean on their
  strong faith and pray that Cheyanna will continue to bravely battle
  her cancer and win. Unfortunately, being in the hospital for the last month has taken a
  financial toll on Cheyanne’s family. Spud works for Liquid Metal and
  Coating as a truck driver and spray tech, which involves weekly travel
  across the country, but after Cheyanna’s diagnosis, he was able to get
  his schedule modified. The company is allowing him to work in their
  local location so he can be close to his family, but by doing so his
  hours were cut to a strict 40 per week, and he lost the overtime that
  had been a huge financial help for his family. Sherry is currently out
  of work so she can stay with Cheyanna in Chattanooga while she is inpatient. When we began looking for a local Chattanooga cause family to feature
  during Ironman Chattanooga, we contacted the Lana's Love Foundation , a 501c3 charity that
  offers support to families with children who have cancer. Holly, the
  director of Lana’s Love, reached out to the Child Life Team at
  Children's Hospital, and the first child they both thought of was
  Cheyanna because of her amazing attitude that leaves a lasting
  impression on all who cross her path. Right after Cheyanna first
  arrived at the hospital in August, she put a telling sign on her room
  door… “Happy thoughts, No Tears.” At just 14 Cheyanna should be
  enjoying 7th grade and playing softball but instead, she is facing her
  Ewing’s sarcoma head on with incredible courage, a positive attitude,
  and her strong faith in God. Team Ride to Give is proud to be participating in Ironman Chattanooga on behalf of Cheyanna to
    help raise funds for medical expenses that are not covered by
  insurance. Her current insurance will pay for much of her
  cancer treatment, but when all is said and done, there will be a large
  bill that is the responsibility of her parents. Please help us support
  Cheyanna's medical expenses by making a tax-deductible donation to
  Ride to Give. For updates, please follow Cheyanna's new facebook page Cheyanna's Journey . Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the

"Jody has had a very rough road these last five years, after being
  diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Colon Cancer. His cancer has spread
  from his colon, to his liver, lungs, lymph nodes, back to his liver
  and most recently, his brain. He has undergone many surgeries, various
  types of chemo, radiation, and the list continues. Due to his
  treatments, and related side effects, he has been unable to work. The
  stress of medication costs, medical supplies, the bills that keep
  coming and daily life is overwhelming. He has had to make many
  sacrifices, giving up work, sports, and much of his social life. When
  he does have time outside of treatment and being sick, he is extremely
  financially restricted. The stress and limitations of his diagnosis
  has been very difficult for him. Amazingly, he continues with his chin
  up and a positive attitude. We are asking for your support so that
  Jody can focus his energy on his health, and minimize the stress and
  worry that he has been under. Here is some information about what he
  has been going through most recently. PLEASE HELP JODY IN HIS FIGHT, AND SHOW CANCER WHO IS BOSS!!! Recent History In August 2015, after 16 months of chemotherapy to shrink tumors that
  had metastasized to his lymph nodes, Jody went to the ER with severe
  back pain. He had developed blood clots in his lungs and was
  hospitalized. He continues to give himself blood thinners through
  injections every day. Since his chemo had been the main contributor of
  his blood clots he had to discontinue this particular “cocktail”.
  Chemo options were getting critically short. Jody had had genetic testing completed to see if he was eligible for
  another type of chemo, which he began immediately, and continued to
  take until December 2015 when the rash he had developed all over his
  body (a side effect of the chemo) became too serious to continue. The
  Team at the Cancer Clinic decided they would try to radiate the tumors
  in his lymph nodes. Before radiation began Jody had a routine CT scan
  which showed that more lymph nodes had developed tumors and the cancer
  had returned to his liver. He had 10 rounds of radiation in March/
  April and then underwent two TACE (Transarterial Chemoembolization)
  procedures in April and May , where they fed a tube through the
  femoral artery and injected chemo directly into his liver to try to
  shrink and control the tumors. Then the 6 week waiting period began for his CT scan, so that we
  could find out how well the tumors had responded to the radiation and
  TACE procedures. During this time Jody developed a headache which
  became progressively worse. A head/neck CT scan on June 20th confirmed
  our worst fear; the cancer had metastasized to his brain. Jody was
  immediately admitted to hospital and started on steroids to bring the
  swelling on his brain down. Four days later he underwent brain surgery
  to remove the tumor and is currently in hospital. Jody is awaiting a CT scan to find out the current status of the
  tumors in his lymph nodes and liver, and his team of doctors at the
  Cancer Clinic will decide what treatments are next for him. It has
  been a very difficult road for Jody, and returning to work in not an
  option for him any time soon. Read more about Jody’s Cancer Fight Jody was first diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Colon Cancer in
  February 2011 when he was just 33 years old. Jody became very sick and
  went to the emergency department where doctors determined that he had
  a complete bowel blockage. It was confirmed that it was CANCER!!! He
  underwent bowel resection surgery (Hartman’s Procedure) to remove the
  blockage, had a colostomy, and then 6 rounds of chemotherapy. He
  learned that the cancer had spread to his liver and, in September of
  that year, he underwent a liver resection surgery to remove the spots
  from his liver. Doctors were able to reverse his colostomy at this
  time. He then had another 6 rounds of chemo, which he finished in
  January 2012. Jody was given the thumbs up to resume life as normal.
  He eagerly went back to work, and was able to play sports again and
  resume normal routines. In July 2013 his world was turned upside down again. The cancer had
  returned, this time in his right lung. We flew to Halifax five days
  after his diagnosis so that Jody could have a PET (Positron Emission
  Tomography) scan to determine how far the cancer had spread and
  whether or not it was present in other organs (this procedure is not
  yet offered here in Newfoundland). The following week he underwent
  lung surgery to remove two spots from his right lung. This was
  followed by oral chemo consisting of 1160 pills. During chemo
  treatments Jody tried to continue work, and even decreased his hours,
  but the side effects were too serious and debilitating. In November
  2013, he was forced to go off work. He finished his chemo treatments
  in March 2014, just in time to celebrate his 36th birthday. We thought
  it was over. One month later, in April 2014, doctors discovered that lymph nodes
  in Jody’s chest were enlarged and they were immediately concerned. A
  bronchial biopsy confirmed that the cancer was back again. This time
  Jody was informed that the cancer was inoperable. He was scheduled to
  have chemo every two weeks indefinitely, in hopes of shrinking the
  tumors and keeping them from spreading further. Jody received
  chemotherapy every two weeks for the next 16 months. But here was a
  long road ahead of him yet.","6,525",,https://fundrazr.com/a18xh7,Help Jody Win his Cancer Fight!,,,
"This is Thom Parkison. Thom is a teacher. He has a passion for teaching and has been
  working in schools and universities throughout the USA and Asia for
  more than 30 years. His motivation is the desire to inspire his
  students to realise their full potential. This year Thom has enjoyed
  working in an international college in Jiangsu Province, China. Until
  recently, he has enthusiastically embraced life here, relishing the
  opportunity to participate in both the school and wider community. Suddenly in July, right before the summer vacation was about to
  begin, Thom was unexpectedly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (think Steve Jobs ). This resulted in
  urgent, major surgery, in China, the very next week. A 9cm cancerous
  tumour, his entire spleen, two-thirds of his pancreas, and an infected
  lymph gland were removed. While the surgery was technically a success,
  Thom instantly became a Type 1 diabetic facing a life time of multiple
  insulin injections daily, not ot mention rigid dietary restrictions. Thom has now started follow-up treatment which entails several
  gruelling rounds of chemotherapy. After his initial round of chemo,
  which should have taken only a few days, Thom endured two additional
  weeks of hospitalisation due to comlications caused by a staph
  infection. Just this one infection tripled the price and duration of
  that one course of chemo. Each medical procedure and bottle
  of medication; every pair of scissors and tweezers; each pack of
  pandages and wad of cottonwool; breakfast, lunch and dinner; has a
  cost. Not to mention the ongoing blood sugar testing strips, insulin
  and diabetic injection supplies which will necessary for Thom. Compounding Thom's current medical situation is the fact that, on the
  15th October, he must leave China creating a further financial burden.
  All of these events have drastically and irrevocably changed Thom's
  life and leave him facing an uncertain future. Thom needs your help. Thom's fundraising goal is US $20,000. This amount will cover the
  cost of his surgery and, remaining three chemo treatments. Funds
  raised in excess of this amount will assist in contributing towards
  relocation costs, the ongoing cost of medication, home-care and not
  being able to work. Team Thom Cancer Campaign (TTCC) is a group of Thom's friends
  and colleagues here in China. Our goal and wish is that after
  completion of chemotherapy, Thom will be able to return to his passion
  of teaching, bringing inspiration to his students, and return to a
  life full of good health and joy. Please help Thom reach his goal. Thank you! Like our Facebook Page Team Thom Cancer

"My sister Susan wrote this for all of you: First of all, I want to thank everyone who has helped me along the
  way. Your support in every way has been an enormous help and I am
  forever grateful. My journey thus far: I have gone to
  Hope For Cancer Institute in Mexico 3 times beginning in October.
  First, for my 21-day initial treatment and twice for follow-ups. At my
  3-month follow-up, I was told I was in stable condition although my
  tumor stayed the same size. At my 7th month checkup this past June, my
  tumor had grown 1 to 2 cm in addition to more affected lymph nodes in
  my groin area, as well as a new lesion. Over the last 8 months, I have been doing virotherapy shots, PNC 27
  suppositories, sonodynamic therapy, near infrared heat, hyperthermia,
  and coffee enemas. I eat little to no processed food, sugar,
  alcohol or dairy. I eat an abundance of vegetables, small
  amounts of organic meats and very small amounts of grains, beans and
  fruit.  I look and feel pretty great considering I have stage 3
  cancer!  My immune system is fully intact and I am still very hopeful
  I can beat this! I have learned many things from Hope 4 Cancer that I still
  incorporate into my anti-cancer regimen but I am ready to move on to
  additional courses of action. What I am doing now: In July 2016, I
  saw an integrative MD in Chicago. My parents and sister paid for a
  very expensive test called “The Greek Test” or R.G.C.C. test, that
  takes your blood and tests it for effectiveness of killing the cancer
  cells against 50 different chemo agents and 50 different natural
  substances. Of the natural substances they tested, vitamin C and
  wormwood (artemisia) had the highest effectiveness rate of killing my
  cancer cells. This test also identified which chemo agents would have
  the most effective killing capacity on my cancer cells. I had several
  other tests done to check adrenals, thyroid, estrogen levels, viruses,
  vit. D levels and toxins to help me uncover the root cause of my
  cancer. My integrative MD is still drawing conclusions from those
  recent tests. I started IPTLD (Insulin Potientiated Low Dose Chemotherapy
  treatments) on Aug. 4th. Each treatment costs $1,093 and I will need
  12 treatments over the course of 9 weeks. Unfortunately, none of this
  is covered by insurance. They also highly recommend weekly, high dose
  Vit C IV’s to keep my immune system boosted. This is an additional
  $175 each week for 12 weeks. Future hopes: I have hopes of moving to Missoula Montana with
  my family within the next 6 months to a year.  Missoula is a healing
  city with access to all I need on a daily basis- accessibility to
  organic foods, different healing modalities, support for alternative
  options, an amazing ND, and a place of hope where one can expect the
  unexpected. Also having 2 sisters, 3 nieces and a nephew there (the
  same age as our 2 kids, Amilia and Leo), is a huge bonus as well. Thank you for your support so far and if you feel moved to help in
  any way, it will be greatly appreciated! Love, Susan and family 1330 Quincy Ave., Racine, WI. 53405 [CM1] e","1,830",of $13k goal,https://fundrazr.com/419p38,Susan Laundrie-Ma Cancer Fund,17,,U.S. Dollar

"PTSD Treatment, Prevention, and Awareness is the current First-Cause
  that unites First Responders across agencies...they're all in a PTSD Crisis. The Cause: Funding is needed for the creation of a First
    Responder Specific Treatment Program for Post Traumatic Stress
    Disorder (PTSD) and Mental illness (MI) in British Columbia, Canada. This program will be focused on meeting the advanced needs of
  Fire Fighters, Police, and Paramedics. The goal is to educate,
  diagnose, and treat First Responders with PTSD and Mental illness
  effectively. All donations are tax-receipted and will go directly to
  PTSD Treatment!! First Responders need help! 1. Up to 35% of First Responders Suffer from PTSD , as a
  result of the traumatic events their jobs expose them to. The
  estimated rate of PTSD/Mental Illness in non-First Responders is 8%. 2. First Responders (FRs) are as a rule neither diagnosed nor
    treated for PTSD/MI. This is because FR's deal with many
  traumatic incidents, and their culuture is to be the helpers, not to
  feel that they need help. The hero complex, in short. But they do need help. 3. First Reponders require different treatment than non-FRs ,
  due to the frequency and intensity of the situations they see and deal with. 4. Specialized treatment for PTSD/MI in First Responders does not
    exist currenlty in BC, Canada. The healthcare system has a
  crack, and FRs are falling into it. Two fundraisers have happened for First-Cause: FireFit for PTSD, and
  currently, Colin's PTSD FireRide, happening NOW!! Colin Thompson is a retired Vancouver Fire Fighter, and he
    cares deeply about First Responders' Mental Health. Colin' s story,
    in his own words, is as follows: ""As a retired firefighter, I know that front-line emergency
    responders are exposed to high levels of stress. In emergencies, we
    put emotions aside as we focus on and deal with tragic events. The
    culture of first responders is to cope with the aftermath quietly
    and move forward to the next call. But we all know that the stress can culminate and lead to Post
    Traumatic Stres Disorder. At its extreme, PTSD has been a
    contributing factor of suicides and family breakdowns. Mood swings,
    alcoholism, relationship conflicts — PTSD can have a very negative
    impact if not treated. I never want to attend another funeral of a brother or sister
    firefighter — or any first responder — who suffered and died from
    this disorder. That's why I'm riding to the Fallen Fire Fighter
    Memorial ceremony in Colorado Springs this September. I'm riding for
    all the first responders who haven't been able to get the help they
    need when they need it. Your donations will go to the Vancouver Firefighters' Charitable
    Society which is committed to supporting a pioneering program at
    Vancouver General Hospital. The Kelty Patrick Dennehy
    Foundation will enhance mental health resources that are direly needed. I didn't get the nickname ""Jack Russell"" for nothing!
    I'm going to spend the spring and summer in training for my
    1,500-mile ride from Vancouver to Colorado Springs. I know I can do
    it! But I need your help. Your donations to my campaign
      will give me the encouragement and drive I need to achieve my
      goal. You will be in my thoughts as I march with the honor guard
      in Colorado Springs. Together, we can be proud to know
    we've done what we can to help the first responders who suffer from PTSD."" The Vancouver Fire Fighters' Charitable Society (VFCS), located in
  Vancouver, BC , Canada. VFCS is a registered Charity

"Firefighters respond to all manner of emergencies, and are exposed to
  hundreds of traumatic incidents during a career. As a result, Firefighters are many times more likely to develop PTSD than the
    general population , and their treatment needs are
  different. Despite this, there are no firefighter-specific
    PTSD treatment programs in place in Western Canada, and I
  want to change that! I think we all do, and your donations will support the creation of a First Responder
      specific PTSD Treatment Program. As a retired Vancouver firefighter, I know firsthand the
    incredible stresses Firefighters face. In emergencies,
  Firefighters and other First Responders put emotions aside as we focus
  on and deal with tragic events. The culture of first responders is to
  cope with the aftermath quietly and move forward to the next call. But
  the stress can culminate and lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
  At its extreme, PTSD has been the driving factor of suicides and
  family breakdowns. Mood swings, addiction, substance abuse,
  relationship conflicts — PTSD can have a very negative impact if not
  treated. Some studies show that 20% or more of all Firefighters suffer
  from PTSD, and almost all cases go untreated. Your tax-deductible donations will go to the Vancouver Fire
  Fighters' Charitable Society which is committed to supporting a
  pioneering program at Vancouver General Hospital. The Kelty Online
  Therapy Service at Vancouver Coastal Health can create a First
    Responder-oriented PTSD Treatment Program but only if we
  can find the funding! The bargain is this: You kindly donate, and I bicycle over 2000
      KM to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where Firefighters from Canada and the USA place the names of those
      lost in the line of duty on the Wall of Remembrance and
  Honour. It is here that the names of a growing number of
  brave Firefighter who have succumbed to the ravages of PTSD are
  engraved. As a past and current member of the Vancouver Fire and
  Rescue Services Honour Guard for over 20 years, I have had the honour
  and the pain of personally presenting our Canadian flag to Fallen
  Firefighters’ family members, as their loved one’s name is placed on
  the Wall, and their final alarm bell is rung. This traditional
  Firefighter Ceremony honours those who have made the ultimate
  sacrifice. I never want to attend another funeral of a brother or sister
  firefighter — or any first responder — who suffered and died from
  PTSD. That's why I'm riding to the Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial
  ceremony in Colorado Springs this September. I'm riding for
    all the first responders who haven't been able to get the help they
    need when they need it. I didn't get the nickname ""Jack Russell"" for
  nothing! I'm going to spend the spring and summer in training
  for my 2000+ KM ride from Vancouver to Colorado Springs. I know I can
  do it! But I need your help. Your donations to my campaign will give me the encouragement and
      drive I need to achieve my goal…Our Goal!!! . You
  will be in my thoughts as I march with the VF&RS Honour Guard in
  Colorado Springs. Together, we can be proud to know we've spearheaded
  the cause of getting treatment for first responders who suffer from
  PTSD. In Colorado this September, I hope to be able to announce that
  the people of Vancouver, the Lower Mainland, BC, and Canada at large
  have pulled together as a team to provide the donations necessary to
  begin providing First-Responder specific PTSD treatment to our
  emergency services workers...treatment made necessary by the very
  nature of our work in helping people. Thank you for you kind support!! This is why the focused PTSD Program for First Responders is so
  important. To make it a reality, we need to comeup with 70K total in
  year one. 10K of that is for the First Responder-Specific Component,
  and 60K is for the PTSD Program Framework. Yearly program maintenance
  is expected to be 20K in year one, as more users of the system come onboard. Lewiston KREW NewsCast Video: http://youtu.be/qxUUsDHRAqY CTV News Story: Recent Tragedy","31,453",of $70k goal,https://fundrazr.com/ey8f1,Colin's PTSDFireRide for First Responders,196,,Canadian Dollar

"Thank you so much for taking the time out to see what our cause is
  all about! My name is April Powe, and I’m the daughter of Tricia Powe
  – one of the most faithful and selfless human beings I’ve ever met and
  I am proud to say she is my mother. There’s no way my parents would
  have ever setup something like this for themselves, so I’ve decided to
  take a leap of faith and ask for help. Through long roads of pain and lifelong health conditions that she’s
  learned to live with and rarely complain about, the pain she
  experienced over the past 6 months has surpassed her ability to be the
  strong mama bear that she is. With the encouragement from my dad,
  Richard, she finally went to see her doctor of 20 years in August of
  this year. After stumbling across the discovery of a small tumor on
  her right kidney during a CT scan, the further testing and scan on the
  tumor came back that the little invader has taken over half her
  kidney, is close to blood veins, and is cancer. The specialist has
  decided it will be best to remove her whole right kidney to avoid any
  spread of cancer, and hopefully once it is removed, she shouldn’t have
  to go through chemotherapy or radiation and should be cancer free. Here is where we run into further problems…Obamacare took away their
  affordable healthcare plan, and they’ve been paying a fee just to NOT
  have insurance. This was because the Affordable Care Act eliminated
  their plan that suited their ages because they no longer met ACA
  standards. This first phase of appointments has gone onto an emergency
  credit card that, thankfully, had enough funds to cover the payments
  for the appointments, labs, and scans. In the meantime my dad has been
  trying to get insurance for them that is affordable for upcoming
  surgery, recovery and any further treatment that may be necessary. The
  trouble is there isn’t a chance to get insurance without being in an
  open enrollment period through employers, and they don’t qualify for
  Medicare, Medi-Cal, Premium Assistance, Covered CA, or Enhanced Silver
  Benefits (yay middle class!). After finally getting the approval by
  “exceptional circumstance”, they were signed up for Blue Cross, and
  paid a premium on top of the money already spent. Finally! Right…? Not
  so fast; they are now in limbo with insurance, backtracked, and are
  being told her circumstance is not an exceptional circumstance to
  qualify and that they were misinformed! How is this even possible? She
  has cancer. This is after already receiving a medical card and
  everything stating coverage started 9/1. They now face the possibility
  of a large sum of medical bills if insurance coverage does not kick in
  until new set date of 12/1 if she appeals their recent denial of
  coverage for September. She still needs a liver MRI this month and
  they denied payment for this month's $3,000 CT scan. My parents are the most humble, patient and kind human beings and
  it’s devastating that they are having to deal with this financial
  burden while taking on the stress of my mom having cancer alone.
  They’ve gone through many job changes, moves, car troubles, and any
  other obstacle you could think of while continuing to trust God’s
  plan, and our family is thankful for the strong leader and support my
  mom has in my dad. They deserve some help, and that’s all I’m asking
  for. A small amount from anyone willing could end up being a
  tremendous help. In her own words, “While I don’t know what the future holds yet, I do
  know the One who holds the future. I have peace. I will do all I can
  to advocate for my health care needs.” Thank you in advance for even taking the time to take interest in
  Tricia’s story in her fight against kidney cancer, and any donations
  made. No matter how long or short this battle may be, medical bills
  are a huge burden on anyone. Nobody deserves the added pressure while
  struggling to get well. <3 ""Cast your burden on the Lord, And He shall sustain you; He

"Les presento a nuestra hija Ivanna Paola; ella es una niña muy
  sonriente a pesar de haber nacido con dos males congénitos, males que
  causaron que su columna tomara una forma de “S” (escoliosis muy
  severa) y que a su vez afectara el tamaño de su caja torácica: no
  tiene costillas del lado izquierdo,la malformación de tórax ocasionó
  que su corazón se desplazara al lado derecho de su pecho y la caja
  torácica este comprimida al 50% y su pulmón izquierdo este al 50% de
  su tamaño y capacidad, esto hace que tenga muchas complicaciones
  respiratorias. Duros retos para soportar a sus poco más de tres años
  de edad. Todo esto le genera a Ivanna dificultades para respirar ya que
  sus pulmones no se desarrollan de forma normal por el espacio reducido
  en su cuerpo. Sin atención médica especializada el pronóstico de los
  doctores es que no vivirá más allá de los 21 años. Ivanna es una pequeña con muchas ganas de vivir y salir adelante. Su
  coraje y valentía nos ha contagiado a su mamá y a un servidor para
  hacer todo lo que esté en nuestras manos para que lleve una vida normal. Para continuar su tratamiento es imprescindible reunir 180 mil pesos
  para que nuestra pequeña Ivanna acuda a la ciudad de Los Angeles en
  California Estados Unidos donde doctores harán varias cirugías en la
  colunma para ir enderezando y haciendo espacio para el desarrollo
  correcto de sus órganos en especial, sus pulmones. Ayúdanos a que Ivanna reciba pronto la atención y el tratamiento

    that his heart will be moved to the right side of his chest and rib
    cage this compressed to 50% and his left lung this 50% of its size

    challenges to support his little more than three years of age. All this brings it to Ivanna difficulties to breathe as his
      lungs are not developed as normal for the space in your

        the doctors is that you will not live beyond the age of 21. vanna is a girl with many desire to live and move forward.

"I would like to share our story… I never thought that I would ever have to tell you about by mom’s
  battle with Cancer, it has been hard to even put the two words
  together “Mom and Cancer”. My mom has always been a hardworking,
  loyal, giving and compassionate to my siblings and I along with many
  other children. She and my Dad have been foster parents for 56 medically fragile
  newborns for L.A. County, which are some of the sickest babies to care
  for. They also adopted 5 of their children for a total of 7 of us.
  Five years ago at the age of 54 she decided to get back into
  professional photography as a business. She has captured so many
  beautiful families and babies within those years. Additionally, she
  has also volunteered her services with the non-profit organization
  called “Now I Lay Me down To Sleep”. She has photographed and captured
  the precious last moments of many babies in the hospital, in the
  middle of the night, during their final moments here on earth while
  their families grieved. That’s not an easy assignment, but with her
  newborn experience and compassion she was often called. I don't know
  how she did that, but she did it. Last year, my Mom started to complain about back pain. She made an
  effort to lose weight and eat healthier. She had some success and this
  helped the back pain a bit, but it was always there. In February of 2015, she leaned over and had a horrible pain and
  spasm in her back. She went to the doctor and was told she had a back
  strain. No x-ray, just instructions on better body mechanics and some
  medication. After two weeks of continued pain, I urged her to get an
  x-ray. This showed a compression fracture of L-1. She was given a hard
  back brace, which helped somewhat, and she kept working. On Friday, March 6th, 2015, our world was turned upside down. My
  sister, Stef, took our Mom to the ER. I was working when she came in
  and I had a bad feeling. When the doctor got the blood test back, he
  walked over to her, where she was alone on a hallway gurney and told
  her she most likely had Multiple Myeloma. Cancer. We were shocked. We
  gave her blood transfusions right away and she was admitted. It was a
  night I will never forget. We saw the oncologist the next day and he did a bone marrow biopsy at
  her bedside. I’ve never heard my Mom scream in pain like that before
  and it made me nauseous. The results came back that she did have
  multiple myeloma and chemotherapy was started immediately. She was
  admitted for two weeks that time. When she was discharged, she
  returned a day later with a high fever and spent time on bi-pap in the
  ICU. In addition, her back had 3 compression fractures and every time
  she was moved, she’d have horrible muscle spasms and scream. That stay
  was about another week. She was given a very high dose of
  chemotherapy- 4 days straight with 4 different meds. She was
  discharged and returned in septic shock a day and a half later. Mom
  was as close to death as anyone can be. I watched my ER staff fight to
  save her life and it is nothing short of a miracle that she survived
  that infection. We have witnessed the awesome power of God. Mom’s prognosis is uncertain. She has finished her chemo and by the
  grace of God she will be starting her Stem Cell Transplant treatment.
  This will require her to be admitted for about 4 weeks at UCLA and
  then another 4 weeks at a location close to UCLA. The procedure will
  not be an easy procedure and many prayers are needed. Although this is a huge blessing, it will also be an enormous
  financial hardship on her family. Needless to say, between co-pays and
  expensive medicines, it gets very expensive. Their medical insurance
  premiums alone are $1354.00 a month, and that’s just to cover the two
  of them. They are blessed to have medical insurance, however it’s so
  costly. So many people have been gracious in so many ways this past
  year, and for that we are forever grateful, especially for your
  prayers and support. We know that my mom is a fighter and will kick
  this cancer to the curb. We need your help, so please consider giving
  a financial gift and most importantly continue praying for her health!
  I am thankful every day she is here.","6,430",of $15k goal,https://fundrazr.com/812l6b,Please Help Us Support Cindy,43,,U.S. Dollar

  rollator costs about $113.00. There will be other things she may
  need...her issues are a former left knee injury, osteoarthritis and
  since the fall, sciatic and piriformis nerve issues, all contributing
  to her mobility problems. She fell for the 3rd time last week after coming
  home from an orthopedic appointment. Sitting in a wheelchair too long
  and in car too long and feet and legs getting cold, added to the
  numbness she already has and she could not feel the stairs and ended up on the first stair while my legs were on the cold
  brick . Rasheedah's mother-in-law who drove her to her

  Dominican Republic. He and five of his dentist colleagues have agreed
  to server students at poor, rural primary schools, providing dental
  screening, cleaning, procedures and education. They require portable equipment, and this is where I and my Rotarian
  compadres here in New Jersey come in. I am raising money to help
  purchase that equipment. Full details of the project can be found here: http://palisades-rotary.org/project-zero-cavities/ My personal goal is $1,000, but the total amount that we need to
  raise is $5,000, so larger donations are certainly welcome. The Rotary Foundation has one of the best charity ratings, with over
  90% of funds raised going towards the projects that are being
  supported ( http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=4553#.Vq0CztDa2Hs ).
  In this case, ALL money I receive will be going directly to the
  project in the Dominican Republic, minus a nominal $9.98 transfer fee
    ( https://www.xoom.com/dominican-republic/send-money ),
  which I will cover myself. I have visited this area of the country, and the communities there do
  not understand the value of dental hygiene . Poor dental hygiene at a
  young age leads to problems later in life, such as mouth and facial
  pain, oral and throat cancer, oral infection and sores, periodontal
  (gum) disease, tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and
  disorders that limit an individual’s capacity in biting, chewing,
  smiling, speaking, and psychosocial wellbeing ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs318/en/ ). Students who need fillings and extractions will be treated, but most
  importantly all students will have their teeth cleaned and they will
  be taught about the importance of keeping their teeth clean. This project is very important to me, and I will be visiting Eugenio
  later in the year to witness the project in action firsthand. Please

"My friend Becky is a crazy, loving, fun spirited, mother, friend and
  woman of god.  Becky has an amazing attitude and giving nature and is
  always on the go.  I am starting this UPDATED fundraiser to ensure
  that her family will not need to worry about expenses while she is
  recovering.  If you can not donate we are asking for prayers..........
  prayers for continued strength for the Rangel famly as well as Becky's
  health.  I have enclosed some information on her illness. WE LOVE YOU BECKY!!!!!!!!!!! What is Chiari Malformation? Chiari malformations (CMs) are structural defects in the cerebellum,
  the part of the brain that controls balance. When the indented bony
  space at the lower rear of the skull is smaller than normal, the
  cerebellum and brain stem can be pushed downward. The resulting
  pressure on the cerebellum can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid
  (the liquid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord) and
  can cause a range of symptoms including dizziness, muscle weakness,
  numbness, vision problems, headache, and problems with balance and
  coordination. Symptoms may change for some individuals depending on
  buildup of CNS and any resulting pressure on tissue and nerves. CMs
  are classified by the severity of the disorder and the parts of the
  brain that protrude into the spinal canal. The most common is Type I,
  which may not cause symptoms and is often found by accident during an
  examination for another condition. Type II (also called Arnold-Chiari
  malformation) is usually accompanied by a myelomeningocele-a form of
  spina bifida that occurs when the spinal canal and backbone do not
  close before birth, causing the spinal cord to protrude through an
  opening in the back. This can cause partial or complete paralysis
  below the spinal opening. Type III is the most serious form of CM, and
  causes severe neurological defects. Other conditions sometimes
  associated with CM include hydrocephalus, syringomyelia (a
  fluid-filled cyst in the spinal cord), and spinal curvature. Is there any treatment? Medications may ease certain symptoms, such as pain. Surgery is the
  only treatment available to correct functional disturbances or halt
  the progression of damage to the central nervous system. More than one
  surgery may be needed to treat the condition. Some CMs have no
  noticeable symptoms and do not interfere with the person's activities
  of daily living. What is the prognosis? Many people with Type I CM are asymptomatic and do not know they have
  the condition. Many individuals with the more severe types of CM and
  have surgery see a reduction in their symptoms and/or prolonged
  periods of relative stability, although paralysis is generally permanent. Syringomyelia /sɪˌrɪŋɡɵmaɪˈiːliə/ is a generic
  term referring to a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord . This cyst, called a syrinx , can expand and elongate
  over time, destroying the spinal cord. The damage may result in pain, paralysis , weakness, [1] and stiffness in the back,
  shoulders, and extremities. Syringomyelia may also cause a loss of the
  ability to feel extremes of hot or cold, especially in the hands. The
  disorder generally leads to a cape-like loss of pain and temperature
  sensation along the back and arms. Each patient experiences a
  different combination of symptoms. These symptoms typically vary
  depending on the extent and, often more critically, to the location of
  the syrinx within the spinal cord. Syringomyelia has a prevalence estimated at 8.4 cases per 100,000
    people, [2] with symptoms usually
  beginning in young adulthood. Signs of the disorder tend to develop
  slowly, although sudden onset may occur with coughing, straining, or myelopathy","2,880",of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/f12zr2,Becky Rangel Chiari/Syringomyelia Recovery Fund.,37,,U.S. Dollar

"Depuis 2 ans, nous avons été à la recherche de fournir un moment de
  joie dans la vie des patients de hémodialyse du département de
  néphrologie de l'Hôpital général Honorio Delgado d'Arequipa Pérou. Ces
  patients sont des gens qui ont aucun ou peu ressources pour surmonter
  cette maladie. L'insuffisance rénale survient lorsque les reins sont
  endommagés et ne fonctionnent pas correctement ainsi les déchets
  dangereux peuvent s'accumuler dans le corps. L'hémodialyse est une
  thérapie de remplacement rénal, qui vise à remplacer en partie la
  fonction des reins. Dans l'Hôpital général d'Arequipa, le Département
  de néphrologie offre à ces patients avec des ressources limitées, la
  possibilité de continuer ce traitement, et de maintenir une vie
  pleine. Le Dr. Eduardo Chavez (Chef du Département de néphrologie) et
  son équipe, a lancé cette campagne il y a quelques années pour fournir
  un Noël pour les patients hémodialysés. Il se compose d'un petit
  déjeuner, et donnations des cadeaux (nourriture principalement).
  Cependant, tout le monde ne peut recevoir des dons parce que notre
  budget est limité. La campagne a jusqu'ici été géré avec l'aide des
  infirmières, des médecins du département et de notre famille. Cette
  année, nous voulons leur donner un peu plus, nous avons pour objectif
  de donner des cadeaux à chacun d'eux et nous avons besoin de votre
  aide pour compléter ce rêve. Il est important que nous cherchons à
  obtenir le plus de ressources financières pour fournir un moment de
  joie dans la vie qui est difficile pour ces personnes. Merci beaucoup
  pour votre aide! ===================================================== For 2 years, we've been seeking to provide a moment of joy in the
  lives of the patients of Hemodialysis from the Nephrology department
  of the General Hospital Honorio Delgado of Arequipa. These patients
  are people who have little or none resources to overcome this painful disease. Kidney failure occurs when the kidneys are damaged and do not
  function properly, so hazardous wastes can accumulate in the body.
  Hemodialysis is a renal replacement therapy, which aims to partially
  replace the function of the kidneys. In the General Hospital of Arequipa, the Department of Nephrology
  provides to these patients with limited resources, the opportunity to
  continue this treatment, and maintain a full life. Dr. Eduardo Chavez (Head of Dept. Of Nephrology) and his team,
  initiated this campaign some years ago to provide a Christmas to the
  hemodialysis patients. It consists of an small breakfast, and giving
  away some gifts (food mainly). However, not everyone can receive gifts
  because our budget is limited. The campaign so far has been managed
  with the help from nurses, some doctors of the department and our family. This year we want to give them a little more, we aim to give gifts to
  all of them and we need your help to complete this dream. It is
  important that we seek to get the most monetary resources to provide a
  moment of joy in the life that's difficult for these people. Thank you very much for your help! ================================================================ Desde hace 2 años, buscamos brindar un momento de alegria en las
  vidas de los pacientes de Hemodialisis del departamento de Nefrología

  penosa enfermedad. La insuficiencia renal se presenta cuando los riñones están
  lesionados y no funcionan correctamente por lo cual pueden acumularse
  desechos peligrosos en el organismo.  La hemodiálisis es una terapia de sustitución renal, que tiene como finalidad suplir
  parcialmente la función de los riñones En el Hospital General de Arequipa, el departamento de Nefrología
  ofrece a estos pacientes de escasos recursos, la oportunidad de poder
  seguir este tratamiento, y mantener una vida plena. El Dr. Eduardo Chavez (Jefe del Dpto. de Nefrologia) inició esta
  campaña hace algunos años para ofrecer unos regalos de Navidad para
  los pacientes de Hemodiálisis. Les damos un pequeño desayuno, y
  sorteamos algunos regalos. Sin embargo, no todos pueden recibir los
  regalos porque nuestro presupuesto es limitado. Esta campaña por el
  momento ha sido manejada con los aportes de las enfermeras, algunos
  médicos del departamento y nuestra familia. Este año queremos darles un poco mas, queremos poder regalar a todos
  y necesitamos su ayuda para poder completar este sueño. Es importante

  She is currently fighting her infection in Alder Hey Hospital and is
  going to be there for at least another six weeks Amelie will need alot of input to get her on the road to recovery and
  get the right side of her body working again. Amelie is definitely
  going to need different toys and sensory equipment to get her brain
  working.  She will need physiotherapy and occupational therapy to help
  relearn lost skills, maintain and develop others. I feel the need to help Amelie not only because she is a baby and
  family but because I know I am one of the lucky ones. My son developed
  bacterial meningitis  20 years ago and thankfully he did not suffer
  any long term effects. To aid this cause I am having my hair shaved off to 1 inch. So for
  some parts that will be a 16 inch cut (my hair will also be donated to
  a charity that makes wigs). All the money raised will go to Amelie so she can have whatever she
  needs to get her brain and body working again to give her the best
  chance of improvement. If you would like to help me raise money for this precious little

  tests and assessments, we learned that she has large duplications of
  her fourth chromosome, and a genetic mutation.  Despite finding these
  issues, we don't know for sure what caused her microcephaly.  Nor do
  we know what the future holds for our dear, remarkable little girl. So far she is developmentally delayed (a 17 month-old toddler who can

"My name is Pauline Enriquez and I have started this campaign for my
  uncle, Ed Paraiso. He has been victimized by attempted-murder and theft in the
  Philippines about a year ago. The people who have robbed him forced
  him to drink acid-infused tea. They left him collapsed on the ground,
  unconcsious from the burning damage the acid was causing in his
  digestive and respiratory tracts. This happened while he was ill with
  Stage 4 Tuberculosis. The incident atop of TB caused Ed's Esophagus to shrivel and
  become useless. Ed has not been able to breathe, eat, or drink without
  Tracheostomy and a Nasogastric Tube. Trying to speak causes him pain, too. Ed has been in the hospital for a year now, solely on his
  wife's average income. The medical expenses have weighed greatly on
  Ed, his wife, and their 10 year old daughter and they are strugging to
  make finances meet. Doctors have attempted to expand his Esophagus through
  intentional wound healing and repair, but it has not been successful.
  It has been decided that the doctors will wait until his Esophagus
  heals because it is still too fragile to operate on. Meanwhile,
  they have opted for a Gastrostomy Tube, but, right now, Ed is far from
  qualification. At 80 pounds, he is too fragile for a G-tube. The doctors sent him home for now. My aunt is trying to help my
  uncle gain weight for the operation. The medicines and weight-gain
  formula that the doctors have prescribed are not easily affordable to
  have regularly. And so, I have come to you, for your help. Any donation given will go toward Ed's medical bills,
  medicines, weight-gain formula, and future medical aid/operations.
  Ed's recovery is a long journey that will need continuous  financial support. Ed is a very humble and caring person who, as a 34-year-old
  father, has alot to live for. Please help us help my uncle Ed survive this crime. Thank you so much in advance.",260,of $500 goal,https://fundrazr.com/c13My5,Save Ed Paraiso,4,,U.S. Dollar
"To My Friends and Aquaintances, My name is Christie Ormshaw Howard, I have created this campaign in
  order to help my father purchase a wheelchair.  He was recently
  diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder, known as Multiple System
  Atrophy - MSA. It is a disorder that impairs your body's involuntary
  functions, including blood pressure, heart rate, bladder function and
  digestion. The condition shares similarities to Parkinson's but the
  rate of progression is much faster.  Treatment for MSA includes
  medications and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms.  However
  there is no cure. The condition progresses gradually, eventually
  leading to death.  Life expectancy is approximately 6 to 9 years.
   Unfortunately, the doctors estimate my father has had the disease 5
  to 6 years already.  Because this illness is terminal, my father has
  been assessed as palliative care.  This helps with the cost of many
  medications and treatments, however, not everything is covered.
   Currently, the Red Cross has provided my father with a wheelchair for
  a period of six months.  After the 6 months, he is required to
  purchase his own.  At this time, my mother and father are living off
  of my fathers disability cheque, which does not cover a lot.  My
  mother is currently looking for a job but has needed to stay home to
  help care for my father.  The price of a wheelchair is anywhere from
  $500 to $5000 depending on your needs.  Any donations are valued and
  will go directly to the purchase of a wheelchair for dad.  Please feel
  free to google MSA to learn further information on this disease.  My
  hope is to provide my father with the care and dignity he deserves at
  this difficult time, as well as provoking others to learn more and
  take up this cause with us in hopes to find a cure. Thank you to
  everyone who has taken the time to read this campaign.","2,795",of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/413m1b,Please help Wayne get the wheelchair he needs!,26,,Canadian Dollar
"My name is Tani. My 26 year old daughter Rose was a healthy, normal
  girl until things started to change when she was fourteen years old.
   Currently she is only 66 pounds (at 5'5"") and we are trying to
  raise money for a new tube feeding formula called Liquid Hope and
  treatments with an Integrative medical doctor that we feel will
  improve her health greatly.  Please read Rose's whole story below to
  find out how things got to where they are and to understand the
  complete picture of the situation.​ ​It started with heartburn and then acid reflux, which led to
  food coming up to the point that within a couple of years, nothing
  would stay down.  She couldn’t even make it to the bathroom when she
  had to throw up, so she kept a bucket with her and wouldn’t eat during
  the day, just so she could go to school. ​ ​During this
  time, she was of course losing weight and we took her to various
  doctors and specialists where she had numerous medical tests, which
  showed nothing was physically wrong with her.  She was labelled as a
  bulimic/anorexic, even though I explained that she wasn’t vomiting on
  purpose.  An anorexic or bulimic hides her illness and does not walk
  around with a bucket and throw up in front of her family.  The doctors
  wouldn’t believe me. ​ ​ It was while I was studying for
  a medical terminology course that I came across the term,
  “Gastroparesis,” which means paralyzed stomach.  I had never heard of
  this condition before so I did some research and discovered that the
  symptoms were exactly what Rose had.  I convinced a specialist to test
  her for it and even told him what type of test she needed, which was a
  nuclear medicine stomach emptying test.  The test came back positive
  for severe gastroparesis, but no one could tell us what had caused
  it.  They labelled it as “idiopathic,” or no known cause, and told us
  her stomach was pretty much useless and all there was to do was just
  monitor her blood levels and gave us no advice or help besides weekly
  blood tests. ​ ​Rose managed to barely graduate from
  high school, but of course college and all her other dreams were out
  of the question.  Her weight plummeted as low as 71 pounds during high
  school (at 5’ 5” tall) and none of the specialists we saw knew much
  about gastroparesis, let alone how to treat it, and didn't seem to
  take it seriously. In recent months her weight has dropped down as low
  as 62 pounds and she is currently only 66 pounds. ​ ​I continued my research and found out about an Enterra therapy
  gastric electrical stimulator that was being used to treat
  gastroparesis successfully for several years in the US, but in Canada
  was only implanted by a couple of surgeons for patients with
  diabetes. ​ ​I narrowed down a surgeon in Montreal and
  convinced him to implant one of these devices in my daughter and in
  February 2009 we made the trip and were there for one month.  The
  surgeon also implanted a feeding tube at the same time, which helped
  her to slowly gain and she eventually got up to 95 pounds. ​ ​After almost two years of trying different settings on the
  device and even making a trip to Mississippi to see the foremost
  doctor in this type of therapy, where Rose saw him daily for a month,
  she turned out to be one of the 5% of gastroparesis patients that this
  device didn’t help and so we had to have it removed.  We couldn’t find
  a surgeon in BC that would remove it, so we had to travel to Calgary,
  Alberta for the surgery. Now we were back to square one and didn’t
  know what to do next.  In the meantime, now that Rose wasn’t eating at
  all and relying solely on tube feeding, she couldn’t even digest her
  own stomach acid and would throw up a litre or two of it a day, which
  led to her needing 23 crowns and 19 root canals and several
  abscesses.  After all that pain and suffering, she ended up having to
  have all her teeth pulled in 2012 at the age of 23 and now has full
  dentures. ​ ​Of course I continued my research and came
  across an online support group for gastroparesis and through that
  found out about several people who had total gastrectomies and were
  able to eat again, even though it was small amounts throughout the day
  and certain foods had to be avoided.  We looked into this very
  thoroughly because removing your stomach is not to be taken lightly. 
  Once we decided that this was our only real option, we needed to find
  a surgeon. ​ ​It turned out that none of the GI surgeons
  in BC were willing to do the surgery on a patient with gastroparesis,
  so we began to look outside of our province and once again had to go
  to Calgary. ​ ​Rose had the surgery and after a month of
  horrible complications and infections we came home.  It has been
  almost three years now and unfortunately Rose is still unable to eat
  and still tube feeds for nutrition. ​ ​It turns out that
  the surgeon who removed her stomach left an 8 cm pouch of stomach
  because it is stronger than attaching the esophagus directly to the
  intestine. Unfortunately that small pouch of stomach still has
  gastroparesis and that is why she is unable to eat.  Because Rose is
  so frail right now there is no way that she could survive another
  surgery to remove the last portion of her stomach, but we are hoping
  that in the future it will be an option. ​ ​Now I must go
  back five years ago to when Rose dug a tick head out of her leg while
  we were sitting outside on our deck.  She first noticed the lump on
  her thigh when she was about fifteen. It was a small lump and because
  she had another small lump in her arm (still has it) and the doctor
  told her it was just a calcium build up she thought that was what the
  one on her leg was. As the years went by it got itchy and closer to
  the surface and looked kind of dark. She started to pick at it over
  the period of a couple of weeks. She saw white at the surface, but
  could see something dark underneath. So finally one day got the
  tweezers and picked out a hard white thing (probably a calcium build
  up) and discovered something dark and squishy underneath.  We
  immediately thought it might be a tick and went inside and did an
  image search of ticks and tick heads, knowing that sometimes when you
  get bitten by a tick the body will get knocked off, but the head stays
  inside. Sure enough the thing she picked out her leg looked exactly
  like the images we saw. We had heard of Lyme disease, but didn't know
  much about it, so I did some research and discovered that Lyme disease
  can cause digestive issues including gastroparesis!  We went to our
  doctor and asked if Rose could be tested and she had the standard
  Canadian test (the ELIZA, which we have since found out is not very
  accurate and most often comes back with false negative results.)
   It came back negative, so we moved on and continued to explore other
  possibilities ​ ​About a year ago a friend of ours was
  diagnosed with Lyme disease by a lab in California.  This particular
  lab specializes in state of the art research and clinical testing for
  Lyme disease and associate tick-borne diseases.  We sent away for a
  test kit, had the test done and the results came back 100% positive
  for Lyme disease, not only by the lab’s standards, but by the US
  Center of Disease Control standards, which is very rare. ​ ​There is no doubt that Rose has been suffering from Lyme
  disease since she was fourteen years old and through my research I
  have found out that Lyme disease can attack the entire digestive
  system and cause among other things, not only gastroparesis, but also
  malabsorption. ​ ​Looking back and trying to figure out
  when Rose might have been bitten by that tick, we remembered that back
  when she was fourteen, we lived in an area known for deer ticks and
  she used to cut through a grassy, wooded property when walking to her
  friend’s house.  It was shortly after that time that her symptoms
  began to appear. ​ ​Lyme disease is easily treated with a
  3 week course of antibiotics if caught in the very early stages, but
  when a person has been sick as long as Rose, treatment can take months
  or even years. Unfortunately here in Canada Lyme disease is very
  controversial and doctors do not recognize or treat it, so most people
  have to seek treatment in other countries, which is very expensive.
  There are some alternative therapies available here in Canada, but
  just like the treatment out of country they are not covered by our
  health care and can end up costing many thousands of dollars.  A
  friend told me about “crowdfunding” so I decided to give it a try and
  amazingly raised $23,000!!  Now we had money, but had to decide the
  best treatment facility to go with. ​ ​After extensive
  research we chose a clinic in Mexico just south of Tijuana and were on
  our way there within a month. Between the team of doctors and
  specialists, both from Mexico and the U.S., their high tech labs,
  state of the art equipment and unlimited restrictions to treat her,
  all of the doctors concur that Rose was in much worse shape than we
  were led to believe in Canada. ​ ​After not being
  properly diagnosed or treated for 12 years, many of her body’s systems
  had reached dangerously low levels. Every day they all worked together
  to address each of these life threatening issues one step at a time.
  The doctors had a clear picture of what needed to be done in order to
  kill the Lyme and the co-infections and boost all of her body systems,
  too numerous to mention. We arrived back home in Canada after 15
  weeks, although we would have liked to have stayed a few more weeks at
  the clinic in Mexico for another very important treatment therapy
  which I will explain, but we had run out of money.  As a matter of
  fact, the clinic was letting us stay and continue treatment on credit
  for 5 weeks and so at that time we owed them $25,000. ​ ​Rose had many different state of the art medical treatments while in
  Mexico, including 350 million stem cells, some of which that were
  directly implanted into her spinal column and small intestine,
  anti-infection Lyme program, natural killer cell therapy, gc MAF,
  neuropeptide therapy, bio magnetic therapy, as well as daily
  nutritional IV's etc.  Rose also had many, many tests done in Mexico
  including, MRI's, a spinal tap, an endoscopy, etc, she also had weekly
  blood tests and her daily IV’s would be adjusted accordingly based on
  the results. There were two tests that did show some abnormalities,
  one of which was a genetic diagnosis test that tests for 180 genetic
  mutations.  Rose has 46 genetic mutations that were present, while not
  all of them are activated.  There was a treatment available and the
  clinic in Mexico was ready to go ahead with it, but we already owed
  them $25,000 and it would be another $15,000 for the new treatment. 
  So once again we launched a crowdfunding campaign and raised more
  money and we headed back to Mexico for 2 weeks. ​ ​The
  doctors in Mexico think Rose’s Lyme disease is gone and she will be
  getting retested by the premier lab for Lyme disease testing in the
  next few weeks. In spite of this, twelve years of untreated Lyme
  disease has taken a major toll on her and she needs all the help she
  can get to rebuild her taxed body. ​ ​Rose has been tube
  feeding since 2009 with commercial formulas and we have never felt
  very good about it because the main ingredient in all of them is
  maltodextrin and the rest of the ingredients are refined and/or
  synthetic.  I just recently found out about a whole, REAL food tube
  feeding formula made in the US that ships to Canada. Please go to
  their website and read about it: http://functionalformularies.com/#sthash.X5AUi5WZ.... be
  sure to read the story of how and why the formula was developed. ​ ​Of course we wanted to get Rose going on this
  formula immediately, but tube feeding formulas are very expensive. The
  one she was using costs about $1000 a month, and is covered by the
  provincial government, whereas this amazing whole food formula is
  not. ​ ​We are about to embark on a fight to have the
  government cover this new one, but it could take some time to
  do because it is from the US and not on the list of covered formulas
  in British Columbia. ​ ​We have fought the government
  before and we have won!  We were the first to ever have our provincial
  medical plan cover treatment at the gastroparesis clinic at the
  University of Mississippi hospital and also to cover the cost of
  having Rose's gastric electrical stimulator surgically implanted in
  Montreal!  I am hopeful we can win this fight too! The new formula
  costs approximately $1300 a month, including shipping. ​ ​Rose is on disability and only receives $900 a month, so there is no
  way she can afford to pay for her own formula. I am working very
  limited hours because of my own health condition (Multiple Sclerosis)
  and we have no savings to dip into. My husband is working, but we live
  paycheque to paycheque.   While we are battling to have the cost of
  this formula covered, we wanted to get her started on this potentially
  lifesaving whole food formula asap and so another crowdfunding
  campaign was launched!  We raised enough money to order a three month
  supply of Liquid Hope and Rose began the slow process of transitioning
  to the new formula. ​ ​The good news is that since Rose
  started on Liquid Hope her blood test results have really improved!
  For example, her hemoglobin, iron, albumen, magnesium, kidney function
  and phosphorus levels are the best they have been in years and she has
  only just increased to three servings a day. She has also gained 3
  pounds!  Can you imagine the improvement when she is up to the full 4
  servings a day??!! ​ ​The bad news is that so far we
  haven't heard anything back on whether disability is going to cover
  the cost of the new formula and we only have enough funds to order a
  few more cases. It could take months to get the approval and so we
  really need your help!! In addition to raising money for Liquid Hope we are also want to take
  Rose to an Integrative medical doctor in Vancouver who comes highly
  recommended.  Several months ago Rose saw an endocrinologist and had
  extensive hormone testing as well as a bone density scan.  It was
  suspected that her hormone levels would be totally out of whack due to
  her extremely low body weight for so many years and considering she
  hasn’t menstruated since she was 14 years old. It turns out that some
  of her hormone levels are so low they can’t even be measured on the
  blood tests!  Rose also has the lowest bone density that the
  endocrinologist has ever seen which means she has severe
  osteoporosis.  Because Rose is so young, the endocrinologist did not
  feel comfortable putting her on synthetic hormones and suggested
  bio-identical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) instead, but
  explained that the treatment is not covered by MSP and is very
  expensive. Here is a brief description of what BHRT is : The term “bio-identical hormones” was coined to describe a
      hormone that is the exact same molecular structure as the hormone
      naturally produced by your body. It is “Mother Nature’s” design as
      opposed to the synthetic hormones created by pharmaceutical
      companies. A bio-identical hormone may be synthesized in a lab,
      but care is taken to create a molecule that is identical in
      structure to the natural form of the hormone. Substrates such as
      soy or wild yam are used because they happen to contain substances
      that are easily changed into the desired bio-identical structures. The integrative MD that we want Rose to see is an expert in BHRT as
  well as many other therapies that could benefit Rose as she tries to
  rebuild her health and we want to be able to go ahead and try
  everything she believes could help. This of course could be very
  expensive. ​ ​Our goal is set at $8,000. Please donate
  what you can and help us make 2015 the year that things finally turn
  around for Rose!! Time is of the essence. This is literally a matter of life and death. ​ ​Below is a comparison of the formula the government
  will pay for that Rose was using since 2009 and Liquid Hope.  After
  looking at the difference in the ingredients of both, I think it will
  be pretty obvious why she NEEDS to switch permanently to Liquid Hope. ​ ​Liquid Hope ingredients: ​ ​Filtered
  water, organic garbanzo beans, organic green peas, organic carrots,
  organic whole grain brown rice, organic whole grain rice protein,
  organic flax oil, organic sprouted quinoa, organic sweet potato,
  organic broccoli, organic almond butter, organic kale, organic garlic,

"At the age of 6 whilst on holiday in south-west Scotland Becca was
  bitten by a tick. We didn't know at that time that ticks could carry
  Lyme Disease. We accepted the Dr's diagnosis when just months later
  she was incorrectly diagnosed with ME/CFS. Becca has been battling
  many health problems ever since unaware that the underlying cause was
  Chronic Lyme Disease. In 2011 she went to university to start her training as a Midwife.
  She was truly having the time of her life, feeling that she had found
  her true vocation and enjoying her Uni social life. Yet her time at
  university was plagued by constant ill health, and month by month her
  health kept deteriorating. Literally weeks before her first year was
  about to end Rebecca was hospitalised and she had no choice but to
  leave university. Within weeks she became wheelchair bound due to
  spasms in her legs which gradually spread through the rest of her
  body. These spasms not only affect her limbs and body but her jaw,
  neck, feet, hands, tongue and eyes. Her eyes spasms make Becca
  functionally blind, the longest episode lasted a terrifying 15 hours.
  She also suffers with many neurological symptoms such as Dystonia,
  brain fog, fatigue, non-epiletic seizures and many more as a result of
  the Lyme Disease. At her worst she requires care 24/7. Chronic Neurological Lyme Disease has turned her life upside down.Yet
  despite the NHS admitting her problems are most likely caused by Lyme
  and allowing her some 'long term' antibiotic treatment, that treatment
  has now been curtailed by NICE guidelines. However whilst on the antibiotics we saw considerable improvement and
  our hopes were raised. If we lived in Germany, Poland or some states
  in America Rebecca could be treated. As we don't, we have had no
  choice but to turn to a Private Hospital in the hope that they will be
  able to cure her. The treatment is extremely expensive but already 5
  weeks in we have seen the most amazing improvements. However our
  savings are dwindling and so we are turning to our friends and family
  to help us launch a fundraising appeal. What price good health?! Becca desperately needs longterm treatment to cure her of this
  debilitating disease and to allow her to get back to her midwifery
  dreams and to just simply living. Please help if you can... Thank you

"Andre Nickolas M. De Jesus (Anicko), was born September 15, 2015.
  Since then his battle begins. He was born with a congenital heart
  decease called Transposition of the Great Arteries. Transposition of the great arteries is a serious but rare heart
  defect present at birth (congenital), in which the two main arteries
  leaving the heart are reversed (transposed). Transposition of the great arteries changes the way blood circulates
  through the body, leaving a shortage of oxygen in blood flowing from
  the heart to the rest of the body. Without an adequate supply of oxygen-rich blood, the body can't
  function properly and your child faces serious complications or death
  without treatment. Transposition of the great arteries is usually
  detected within the first hours to weeks of life. To date, Baby Anicko has undergone two procedures (Balloon

"A while back we were contacted by a mom of three special needs
  children who were all on a very special cheerleading team. She was
  looking for help sending them to the UCA International All Star
  Championship competition in Orlando. She
  explained, ""There are 15 awesome kids with differing diagnosises
  and abilities on this team. There are kids with service dogs,
  wheelchairs, feeding tubes, and other medical devices. The best part
  is that all are a part of the team and pushed to do their best."" As I read her words, it struck me that we are an ARMY, and I wondered
  aloud to Dave, “How about we try to send the whole team?” Gina Nicholas is the owner of Legion of Allstars gymnastic and
  cheer school in Griffin, Georgia.  From the beginning, Gina wanted to
  find a way to give back to her community and she has done so in a big
  way. Among her many students, 15 stand out as exceptional athletes not
  only for their dedication but for having overcome emotional and
  physical obstacles.  These 12 female and 3 male athletes aged 9 to
  early adulthood have all faced challenges ranging from developmental
  delays to cerebral palsy to Down’s syndrome and other chromosomal disorders. They are the amazing members of the Ice Angels Cheer Squad. Gina formed the Ice Angels three and a half years ago. Her biggest
  goal for the team has been to provide these athletes and their
  families with a place of refuge. Gina has never charged these special
  needs families for their participation in the Ice Angels cheer
  program. She feels with all the financial responsibilities each family
  faces, there should be a place where their children can forget about
  their problems and simply enjoy life without adding stress to their
  family’s budget. Anything to do with this team is gifted directly to
  these athletes and families. From hoodies, T-shirts, shoes, etc.
  to tickets to local cheer events, Gina’s goal is to improve the
  quality of the lives of these children. For the 2015-2016 season, the Ice Angels have been invited to attend
    this cheer competition in March in
  Orlando. Gina wants to provide each of the squad members with a new
  custom fit cheer uniform and a full scholarship. This is a daunting
  task when you think about the cost of all 15 squad members and their
  families making the trip. But Gina is passionate about the Ice Angels
  and so are we. It would be a dream come true for these families to watch their
  athletes perform in Orlando. So much time, money, and effort is given
  by these parents simply maintaining their child’s health that most of
  them never get to enjoy the experiences the rest of us do. Because of
  medical expenses and therapies, finances are tight. Many squad members
  are in and out of hospitals every few weeks. This trip to Orlando
  would be the calumniation of months of hard work. Each member of the
  squad deserves the chance to perform for a wider audience, hear the
  roar of the crowd, and experience the pride that comes from
  participating in a real cheer competition. Over the next six weeks we will be introducing you to this
    amazing group of young athletes, one every other day. Please make

"This is our friend Steve Fox. We've known him for many years, and it
  feels like he's been in our lives forever. Yes, he's that kind of
  friend. Steve grew up in Wichita Falls, lived in Dallas (where he
  lived when we met him) and he moved to Houston in 2002. Steve is a
  long time Texas music fan and supporter. Can't even begin to count the
  number of benefits he's helped with and supported across the state.
  Dallas folks might remember seeing him at Love & War in Texas and
  all the haunts with Texas music. Houston folks might remember seeing
  him as a staple at Blanco's. He's also been with the Gatekeepers at
  the Houston Stock Show and Rodeo since 2003, serving as Committee
  Captain from 2006-2008 and Committee Coordinator from 2012-2014. This
  is another huge charitable thing he does every year. He's always there
  for anyone who needs him, and will do anything he can to help without
  asking anything in return. It's our turn to help right back. Steve was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and is going to kick its
  ass. He will be having surgery in January, he is waiting on some test
  results before setting the exact date. Friends have asked “what can we
  do?”. Here it is, if you can. We'd like to get his sister Janet flown from Dallas to Houston so she
  can be with him during the surgery and first several days of recovery.
  We'd like to have her use Uber to the hospital and to anywhere else
  she needs while taking care of him. He'll likely miss at least three
  weeks worth of work, which we'd also like to get covered. We've set a
  goal of $3000, and if we are fortunate enough to raise more, it will
  go toward paying his hospital bills. He has insurance, but those
  “percentages” add up quickly! If you would like to and are able to
  contribute, please know it is greatly appreciated by Steve and by
  those of us who love him.",910,of $3k goal,https://fundrazr.com/d143B6,Please Help with Medical Expenses for Steve Fox!!,10,,U.S. Dollar
"Our friend Jerritt Sabiston needs our help. Married to Barb, they are
  raising 2 great boys. They’ve always been involved in helping make the
  community a better place and have been there to support their friends
  and family. In November 2013 when he was 42, Jerritt was diagnosed
  with a tumour on his spinal cord and underwent surgery. Oligodendroastrocytoma is the form of cancer Jerritt has. It is very
  rare, and proving to be stubborn to treat. With determination and a positive attitude, he has gone through chemo
  and 2 rounds of radiation treatments here in Alberta, but
  unfortunately they haven’t had the results hoped for. His doctors have
  said he is free to pursue other treatments. After researching options,
  Jerritt has applied to and been accepted into the Mayo Clinic in
  Rochester Minnesota starting December 1/15. This will be 5-8 business
  days for a consult and tests to determine whether treatments can even
  be offered. Unfortunately, this option is not covered by Alberta
  Health Care, nor is it covered by his or Barb’s employment health
  plans. The cost of the consult and initial testing has been quoted at
  US$20,200 and must be pre-paid. The cost of treatment plus travel and
  other expenses would be additional and all costs are subject to
  current exchange rates. You can see that it could add up very quickly. Here is our chance to help out! Please lets do what we can to help
  take away the financial burden that Jerritt and Barb face so they can
  focus on getting treatment. Every bit helps, so please donate if you
  can and share this story.","41,300",of $30k goal,https://fundrazr.com/714dd6,Help Jerritt Fight Cancer!,216,,Canadian Dollar

  limited mobility, he continued to hold all of his classes while
  seeking solutions to his injury. With an MRI it becase clear that

  waits for the surgery, the greater the risk that the tendons will
  shorten and cause permanent damage. All funds that are donated will be given directly to Titan to use for
  his medical costs. Donations through FundRazr incur a 10% admin charge

"I'm reaching out to my online family to help in my financial journey
  to treat my Hiatal Hernia. I was diagnosed 4 years ago but the pain
  has been so severe lately that I have become a candidate for Bariatric
  surgery to cure this ailment. Here's the break down: The hiatus is an opening in the diaphragm (a muscle separating the
  abdomen and chest) that the esophagus or swallowing tube passes
  through to reach the stomach. If the hiatus weakens and stretches,
  part of the stomach and/or the esophagus can squeeze into the chest
  cavity, producing a hiatal hernia. In a sliding hiatal hernia (which
  is what I have), the stomach and the esophagus slide up into the chest
  through the hiatus. The procedure will be removing this weakened part of the stomach. I have already missed an ample amount of time from work, spent most
  of my monthly income on doctor visits, and have spent most of my days
  off in bed. Between now and my surgery (which is scheduled for January ) I have to pay for : Monthly Surgeon

"Everyone at Maid in Scotland wants to let you know what we are
  raising money for and why. So here we have a few words from Maid Suki. My mother was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in November 2014.
  Some of you may know Motor Neurone Disease as ALS (what the disease is
  called in the USA),and you may have raised money for this last year
  with the Ice Bucket Challange. If you did then I'd like to say thank you. MND is a muscle wasting illness which can lead to the loss of the use
  of muscles that control speaking, walking, swallowing and results in
  paralysis and eventually death. There is no cure; it is terminal. A few years ago my mother started to lose the muscles in her hands.
  At first we all thought it was arthritis but tests confimed it wasn't.
  The problem with diagnosing MND is that there is no way to confirm
  that is is MND except for ruling out every other possibility until MND
  is the only one left, so it took a long time for us to get a diagnosis
  and for us to retrieve the proper help.  Most of that help consists of
  visits from MND nurses and specialists who can give all of us advice
  and support. Of course this illness is awful for my mother, but it is also
  horrible for my father and myself. I've found myself crying at least a
  few times a week ever since i found out, feeling like i've already
  lost my mother even though i know she's still alive and hopefully will
  be for a while. This is known as Anticipatory Grief and it's
  completely normal when someone you love is given a terminal diagnosis. My friends have been an incredible help, none more so than my
  amazing fellow Maids and Butlers at Maid in Scotland. When they
  suggested to me that we could all raise money for MND Scotland I
  couldn't believe how amazing they all were. The money you donate will go towards grants for families like mine so
  building work can be done to their house, whether that be to fit
  stairlifts or to build downstairs bedrooms and bathrooms for when the
  family member with MND can no longer make it up stairs. It will go
  towards councilling sessions for everyone involved, and of course it
  will go to breakthrough research to one day find a cure for this disease. Thank you to every single one of you who has been able to donate
  money or come to one of our events, and even if you cant donate then
  please share this so we can raise as much money as possible. Motor
  Neurone Disease is still fairly unheard of and although the Ice Bucket
  Challange did shine the spotlight on it last year, the charities still
  don't have a lot of money, so anything you can donate will make a hugh
  difference. Thank you so much ~Maid Suki",127,of £1k goal,https://fundrazr.com/412LZe,maid in scotland/cosplayers support MND/ALS,10,,Pound Sterling
"Brayden will be 6 years old in December of 2014, but his mental and
  physical abilities are that of a toddler due to complications of his
  Heart Condition known as CCTGA. Our goal is to raise $20,000 by the time Brayden goes for his Major
  Heart Surgery, in order to help his family cover daily and monthly
  expenses. His mother and father might have to take upwards of a month
  or 2 off of work in order to be by Braydens side and to help him
  recover. Brayden's Doctors will let his family know when he is strong
  enough for the surgery, which could be any time in the near future. About Brayden: -He had his first heart surgery at 3 months old, and now has a pacemaker. -Brayden lives in Red Deer with his parents and 3 older siblings. His
  family moved from Saskatchewan in order to be closer to The Childrens
  Hospital where he will need to have his surgery. They chose Red Deer
  because it was between Calgary and Edmonton where they must travel
  monthly for Brayden to visit all kinds of Specialists (Doctors). -He received a Scholarship to attend Aspire (Aspire Special Needs
  Resource) in Red Deer from the age of 3 to 5. He learned some sign
  language while there, and can also say a few simple words, but
  'cookie' is his favorite. Although he is still learning to walk and
  talk, Brayden now attends Kindergarten where he is able to continue to
  interact with other children. -He is learning to use a walker to get around, but still prefers to
  crawl and pull himself up around the house. When the family leaves the
  house, Brayden is pushed in a stroller or his wheelchair since he is
  unable to walk on his own. -His heart condition has lead to many other problems and expenses.
  For example, Brayden has already had ear implants, cataract surgery,
  and dental surgery requiring hospital care. Brayden may likely require
  life long care. -He loves to watch cartoons and to play with his brothers and sister.
  Cookies are his favorite snack. He loves splashing around in the pool
  during the summer and listening to music while riding in the family
  van. He and his family are huge Rider Fans and Brayden loves to be
  part of the excitement when the games are on TV. How your Donations will help: The goal is to have enough funds to cover basic household bills and
  travel expenses while Brayden is in the Hospital, such as rent, power,
  electricity & water, groceries, gas, hotels and meals. Funds may
  also be used for mobility equipment such as a larger wheelchair,
  walkers, and foot & ankle braces, as well as dental appointments,
  medication, educational items, etc. Thank you so much for taking the time to read a bit about
    Brayden and his family. God Bless all those who are able to donate,

"I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord.  Psalm 118:17 My name is Avin Garcia, the single mother of an amazing 17 year old
  son. Since November 2010, I have been on a faith and healing journey
  against cancer. I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast
  cancer (invasive lobular carcinoma). Both of my breasts were removed
  but the cancer spread to other areas: ovaries, intestines, pelvic
  bones, skull bone interior, bones and tissues surrounding and behind
  the eyes. I go for weekly appointments to have my abdomen drained due
  to the development of Acites, a condition that fills my abdomen with
  fluid to the point of extreme discomfort and pain. Every 2-3 months I
  require a blood transfusion which becomes more challenging to find a
  blood-match each time because my body develops anti-bodies with each
  new transfusion. Below is the most recent update I received from my doctor
    regarding my latest CT and Bone Scan results: ""Hope you are doing well. I must say I can see God's power in
  your life. I was so worried about your scan results but God surprised
  me again. Your CT scan results show no progression in the cancer.
  Radiologist mention mild enlargement of pelvic masses but overall no
  change. Your bone scan also was essentially the same. Cancer markers
  in the blood higher but I don't know if we can make anything out of
  that, so basically it comes down to the fact that current treatment is helping to prevent growth
      of the cancer ."" My faith and healing journey has been blessed by many supporters.
  Through God’s grace and provision I have been provided with the
  ability to pursue an alternative treatment to chemotherapy/radiation.
  As you can read above, my doctor states “ current treatment is helping to prevent growth of the cancer .” The medicine my doctor is referring to is called
  trimethylbicyclonitraminoheptane or 714X for short and its only
  available on approval through Health Canada's Special Access Program.
  Unfortunately, this medicine is not covered by any health care program
  and is very expensive. Each treatment costs $800 for a 21-day cycle. I
  have been consistently administering 714X since the end of November
  2013 via daily injections into my lymphatic system and inhalation with
  the use of a nebulizer.  My goal is to raise enough money to pay for
  eleven approved cycles of 714x. 714X is classified as an immunomodulator, which in simple terms means
  it will modulate the immune system. 714X provides Nitrogen in a
  carrier of Camphor, combined with two different mineral salts and 18
  different trace minerals, all of which serve a purpose in helping our
  immune systems function properly and optimally. 714X does three things: 1) It liquefies the lymph fluid and helps rid my body of toxins, no
  matter what the pathology being treated is. 2) Nitrogen is essential to immature cells, i.e. cancerous cells. In
  order to obtain nitrogen from otherwise healthy cells, cancerous cells
  secrete a substance which paralyzes the immune system. 714X, which
  introduces an exterior source of nitrogen, does not aim to destroy the
  cancerous cells, it aims to saturate them in nitrogen, therefore
  eliminating their need to secrete the substance which paralyzes the
  immune system. Thus 714X unblocks the immune system which will then
  undertake its proper functions once again. The cancerous cells will
  then be eliminated by the body just as the immune system will
  eliminate a splinter caught in our skin. 3) Provides the body with 18 essential minerals and two different
  mineral salts that our bodies need which helps to feed the healthy
  cells.  (FYI: Our bodies need 90 essential nutrients for optimal
  health, and I have finally been getting them through the use of the
  Youngevity products that I mention below.) If you'd like more information on 714X please see
  the following links: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/index-eng.php http://www.cerbe.com/ My plan is simple:  continue to stop the growth of the cancer with
  the use of the 714x and then continue to destroy the cancer cells by
  strengthening my immune system through nutritional supplementation
  with products from a company called Youngevity which provides all 90
  essential nutrients. I've been using these products for just over a month and even in this
  short time the results have been phenominal. Within the first 4 days
  the tumors around my eyes began shrinking; the pain in my abdomen
  disappeared; I am able to eat proper meals again without my body being
  traumatized; my energy levels have increased; my circulation has
  improved; the amount of fluid that is drained from my abdomen has
  decreased over the last two drains; and my overall well-being has
  significantly improved. If you would like to order any of the Youngevity products,
    become a preferred customer or a distributor, please use Customer ID #101336239. If you'd like more information on the Youngevity products or the health benefits of mineral supplementation, please

"Hi, my name is Natalie Staples-Cook and I have been diagnosed with
  stage 4 abdominal cancer. Six years ago, while pregnant with my daughter, Phenix, I was first
  diagnosed with ovarian cancer at the age of 21. After she was born, I
  decided to have a total hysterectomy in hopes to prevent the cancer
  from coming back. On May 4th, 2015 I had another surgery which showed my cancer had
  sadly returned in my abdomen. Since then I have been having to deal
  with mulitple things. I needed to have 6 feet of my small intestine cut out because it was
  completely destroyed by the cancer. Because of that I now have an
  ileostomy bag. It is a bag attached to my hip and is where all my
  bowel movements go. This bag has been one of the hardest things to get
  used to and I am still learning how to take care of it. Also, after finding out this hard news, I decided I needed to make
  the decision to separate from my husband. I wasn't receieving any
  support from him and he couldn't care for me properly. He seemed to be
  running from the situation. Thankfully I have a lot of support from my
  family. Therefore, my daughter and I moved an hour away from where we
  had been living to live with my parents. They take care of me and give
  me the support and care I deserve, particularly my mother, Susan. While battling with the cancer I have lost a significant amount of
  weight. I struggle with an appetite and hospital stays have become all
  too familiar. We recently got news that my cancer is not reacting to the
  chemotherapy. We are now concentrating on living life to the fullest,
  as much as I can in between feeling sick and hospital stays, and
  making memories with my beautiful daughter. Despite of everything, my daughter and I are trying to stay positive
  and take everything day by day. Your support and prayers and have

"Le petit Arthur C’est le 5 mars 2015 que le petit Arthur voit le jour. Quelques jours
  après sa naissance, les parents Audrey Lefebvre et David Mathieu sont
  informés que leur petit ange à une malformation du foie causé par une
  inflammation. Cette malformation s’appelle l'atrésie des voies biliaires .
   C’est une maladie relativement rare qui débute dans la petite enfance
  et qui touche environ un nourrisson sur 10 000 à 20 000. Lorsque l’on
  est atteint de cette rare maladie, le conduit allant du foie à
  l'intestin se détériore, ce qui empêche le foie d'évacuer la bile.
  Dans les premiers stades de la maladie, le conduit biliaire situé à
  l'extérieur du foie est principalement affecté, mais aux stades plus
  avancés, les conduits biliaires situés dans le foie se détériorent eux
  aussi. Une accumulation de bile peut alors se former dans le foie et
  l'endommager. Si l'écoulement de la bile ne peut être établi, la
  fonction hépatique est graduellement perdue La cause de l'atrésie des voies biliaires est inconnue. Ce n'est pas
  une maladie contagieuse : elle ne peut être transmise d'un enfant à un
  autre. L'atrésie des voies biliaires ne semble pas héréditaire et
  n'est liée à aucun aspect des soins prénatals. Actuellement, les
  chercheurs croient qu'il s'agit d'un processus complexe qui cause
  l'inflammation et le blocage des voies biliaires. L’opération de Kasai Il est essentiel d'établir l'écoulement de la bile. Si l'écoulement
  de la bile n'est pas établi, le foie se détériorera de façon continue,
  ce qui entraînera une insuffisance hépatique. Le traitement le plus
  courant est la procédure de Kasai. Cette opération permet de retirer
  le conduit biliaire endommagé situé à l'extérieur du foie et de le
  remplacer par un nouveau système de drainage fait à partir d'une
  partie de l'intestin grêle. C’est âgé de moins d’un mois qu’Arthur a
  subi cette opération qui n’a malheureusement pas eu les résultats escomptés. La greffe hépatique La solution restante, la greffe hépatique, une opération d’une durée
  de 8 à 14 heures. Amenant sont lots de complications, la greffe
  hépatique demandera à la famille de rester à Montréal pour une  durée
  indéterminée. Afin de diminuer les coûts, ils seront hébergés au Manoir Ronald McDonald . Par
  contre, plusieurs autres dépenses seront engendrées (les repas,  le
  stationnement, etc.). Pour l'instant, Arthur va relativement bien. Il doit être gavé toutes
  les nuits pour s'assurer qu'il grandisse et grossisse un maximum pour
  être au meilleur de sa forme pour la greffe. Il est sur la liste de
  greffe depuis le mois de juillet. Bien qu'il soit au haut de la liste,
  il est impossible de savoir quand il sera appelé pour recevoir sa
  greffe. Le fait qu'il soit petit réduit de beaucoup la liste de
  donneur potentiel. C’est donc dire que la greffe pourrait avoir lieu
  le mois prochain autant que dans plusieurs mois. Dans le cas d'un
  délai plus long, il se pourrait qu'il doive être hospitalisé avant
  même de recevoir sa greffe si son état le nécessite. Il y aurait aussi
  une autre possibilité: un donneur vivant. A ce moment-là ils coupent
  une partie du foie d'un donneur compatible pour le greffer à quelqu'un
  d'autre. Comme le foie est un organe qui se régénère, le foie du
  donneur revient à sa grosseur initiale dans un délai de 6 mois. La
  maman d’Arthur a entamé les démarches pour faire les tests de compatibilité. De plus, dès la greffe, on administre des médicaments
  immunosuppresseurs pour éviter le rejet du foie greffé. Au début le
  corps ne veut pas reconnaître, accepter cet organe, qui n'est pas de
  lui et il envoie des cellules et des produits pour endommager ce
  greffon. On donne donc des médicaments pour empêcher ces cellules
  destructrices de fonctionner. L'ennui, c'est que l'enfant devient
  alors plus sujet aux infections. Il est donc  impératif de le garder à
  l'abri des infections et donc d'éviter les contacts avec des personnes
  malades, ainsi qu'avec des animaux. En ce sens, aucun contact avec le
  public n’est permis. À cet instant, une simple grippe pourrait lui
  être fatale. De là, impossible pour les parents de retourner
  travailler et encore moins à l’enfant d’aller à la garderie. Levée de fond Si nous vous demandons votre aide aujourd’hui, c’est pour aider la
  famille Lefebvre-Mathieu à donner un nouveau départ au petit Arthur.
  Sa maman, Audrey Lefebvre, est serveuse et bénéficiera pour les
  prochains mois que du maigre salaire octroyé par le Régime Québécois
  d’Assurance Parentale (RQAP). Son papa, David Mathieu,  conseiller en
  développement des affaires, a dû prendre un congé afin d’être auprès
  de sa famille dans ces moments difficiles. Nous croyons qu’avec la générosité de tous, il sera possible de faire
  une différence dans la vie du petit Arthur et de ses parents. Nous
  vous remercions déjà de votre générosité et nous vous serions
  reconnaissants de parler d’Arthur dans votre entourage. Ensemble, nous
  pouvons faire la différence. ................................................................................................. The little Arthur Baby Arthur is born on March 5th, 2015. Only a few days after birth,
  Arthur's parents, Audrey Lefebvre and David Mathieu are informed that
  their angel has a liver defect caused by an inflammation; this
  inflammation is called biliary atresia.Biliary atresia is a relatively
  rare disease that begins in early infancy and affects about one in
  every 10,000 to 20,000 infants. In biliary atresia the bile duct that
  leads from the liver to the intestine becomes damaged preventing bile
  from leaving the liver. In the early stages the bile duct outside the
  liver is mainly affected, but in later stages bile ducts inside the
  liver are also damaged.  This can lead to build up of bile in the
  liver which can be harmful to the liver. Unless bile flow can be established. The cause of biliary atresia is not known.  It is not contagious, and
  it cannot be passed from one child to another.  Biliary atresia is not
  believed to be related to genetics, and is not connected to any aspect
  of prenatal care.  Researchers currently believe that a complex
  process causes inflammation and blockage of the bile ducts. Kasai Procedure It is essential that bile flow is established.  Otherwise, the liver
  will suffer ongoing damage, resulting in liver failure.  The most
  common treatment is an operation called the Kasai procedure . 
  In this operation, the damaged bile duct outside the liver is removed
  and replaced with a new drainage system made from a piece of the small
  intestine. Little over a month old, Arthur undergoes this surgery that
  unfortunately does not bring the expected results. Liver Transplant The only option left is a liver transplant. It is a procedure that
  can last anywhere between 8 and 14 hours and in itself brings its lot
  of complications. The liver transplant will require the family to stay
  in Montreal for an undetermined period of time. To alleviate the cost,
  they will be staying at Manoir Ronald McDonald. However, other
  expenses will be generated (food, parking etc). Arthur is doing relatively well at the moment. He needs to be stuffed
  every night to ensure growth and strength. He will need both for the
  transplant. He has now been on the donors list since July. Even now
  that he is at the top of the list, it is impossible to know when he
  will get his transplant. Being so young and small also limits the
  number of potential donor meaning the transplant could be next week or
  in many months! If the wait gets too long, he might need to be
  hospitalized before he gets the transplant if his condition requires
  it. There is one other possibility: a living donor. A compatible
  living donor would cut a part of his liver to donate and transplant
  that part to someone else. Since the liver is a regenerative organ,
  the donor's liver gets back to its original size within 6 months.
  Arthur's mother has taken the necessary steps to determine compatibility. Furthermore, the moment the organ is transplanted, Arthur will need
  to be on immunosuppressant medication to prevent rejection of the
  liver. The body does not want to recognize the organ which he did not
  create and so the body will fight the transplant and try to ruin the
  new, invading organ. Immunosuppressant’s are used to counteract the
  body's ability to fight the transplant but by suppressing the natural
  defense through immunosuppressant, the body becomes much more prone to
  infections. It is therefore imperative to keep the child away from any
  infections, reducing contacts with sick people and animals. All
  contact with public spaces must be avoided since a simple cold could
  be deadly. It would therefore be impossible for the parents to go back
  to work or for the kid to be sent to the nursery. Fundraiser If we ask for your help today, it is in order to help the
  Lefebvre-Mathieu family to provide a new start for Arthur. His mother,
  Audrey Lefebvre, works as a waitress and will only earn over the next
  months the meager salary granted by the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan
  (QPIP). His father, David Mathieu, a Business Development Advisor, had
  been taking some time off to be with his family in this difficult time. We strongly believe that with everyone's generosity, it will be
  possible to make a difference in little Arthur's life. We can't thank
  you enough already for your help and encouragement, we are so
  appreciative and make sure that Arthur knows he is surrounded by
  people who care. Together, we can make a difference.","7,695",of $15k goal,https://fundrazr.com/e12Gb5,Help the little Arthur to have a new start !,109,,Canadian Dollar

"In March our lovely friend Jane was surprisingly diagnosed with
  secondary metastatic cancer - surprisingly, as her recovery from her
  oesophagectomy was going well and the signs for a full recovery had
  been positive. The cancer has spread to her peritoneal region (lower
  abdomen) and currently the NHS can only offer palliative care and have
  given her a very poor prognosis of less than 6 months. With a husband
  and three young children, endless rounds of chemotherapy (that the
  oncologists say may only add a few weeks to her life) is not an option
  that Jane can accept and she has been having treatment in Germany
  where the doctors are more holistic in their approach and provide
  treatment that is unavailable on the NHS. This treatment, along with
  all the other approaches she is taking to achieve Radical Remission
  are expensive but all of them have a lot of evidence behind them in
  helping to heal even secondary cancer. It is now that Jane needs these
  treatments and care, so it is crucial that the cost of these are not

"As many of you know, sweet little Laurel Taylor began having health
  problems near the end of 2014. It quickly became serious and she has
  now been in the hospital since December 15. She and her parents were
  flown from Vancouver Children’s Hospital to Toronto’s Hospital for
  Sick Kids where she continues to undergo testing and treatment. The
  Taylors are strong in their faith and are trusting God for the
  direction this journey will take; Laurel has a big mountain to climb.
  We have had many of you ask if there is way to help them out
  financially during this difficult time, and so we have started this
  page to make it easier to collect donations. Anything to help with
  living and travel and extra medical expenses during this time will
  help to make this difficult situation just a little bit easier. Please
  also continue to keep Laurel in your prayers. Thank you! -Len & Tineke Theisen Here is Laurel’s story so far, as told by her parents: “Our 8-year-old daughter, Laurel, has been healthy all her life until
  this past fall, when we noticed she didn’t want to partake in certain
  activities like swimming, riding her bike, playing outside. She also
  began to lose weight, become more tired during the day and sometimes
  get out of breath easily. Our family doctor referred us to a
  pediatrician who we saw on December 11, 2014, and said that he heard a
  loud a heart murmur, and noticed that her liver was enlarged. Four
  days later we were at BC Children’s Hospital where Laurel started
  undergoing more investigation from the Cardiology Department. We soon
  learned it wasn’t a murmur, the doctors told us she had Primary
  Pulmonary Hypertension. Laurel started needing oxygen support because
  her lungs weren’t getting enough oxygen and were having a hard time
  getting rid of the carbon dioxide in her body. Her lungs also began to
  fill with fluid due to her heart working very hard, caused from the
  P.P.H. The Cardiology team and Respiratory team at BC Children’s felt
  that based on Laurel’s symptoms, she had a very rare condition called
  Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease. The only successful treatment for
  this disease is a lung transplant. We were then sent to Toronto’s Sick
  Kids Hospital for Laurel to have a lung transplant assessment, first
  of all to get a diagnosis of her condition, and undergo testing to see
  if she is a candidate for transplant. This could take up to two
  weeks.  We will soon have a confirmation of a diagnosis and how
  doctors will continue with her care. The Transplant doctors have told
  us everything looks good so far for Laurel to be a candidate for a
  transplant.  If Laurel gets listed I (Michelle – her mom) will be
  staying with Laurel in Toronto while, Shawn – her dad, will stay in
  Toronto as long as he can, then travel back to Quesnel to care for our
  10 year old daughter and resume responsibilities at home. We would be
  relocated for approximately two years and this includes
  post-transplant.  Shawn and our older daughter would come to Toronto
  to visit sometimes. That is our plan so far but we know that our plans
  will get tweaked along the way.” -Shawn & Michelle Taylor","28,202",,https://fundrazr.com/4vRbd,Lots of Love for Laurel,,,

  disk disease, amoung a few other dieases. Starting the first of the year, she has to begin a journey to have
  ALL her major limbs replaced or implanted. It will start with the cerivial spine with 3 nerve damages, Once that
  heals, they will do surgery on her back, then both knees and both hips
  need full replacments. Last her right shoulder which also have several
  tares in it.  so, this is a very long journey over the next 2 years. Without her upfront co-pays, she will not begai to get to the out of
  pocket benefits in it all.  And the surgeries will not happen. Just $ 5 from some friends who share with their friends can make
  these surgeries possible. She can get the hospital to work with her, however, you first have to
  be in the hospital for that to happen.  The cost is around $ 7,900 for
  the year before out of pocket will kick in and so she is short around
  4500 for this coming year. Without such surgeries, she may end up loosing the use of her limbs
  and will end up in a wheel chair for life.  The nuropathy has made all
  the stress of the limbs worse, and harder to heal. It creates
  complications. Certain medications that could slow it down she can not
  take. So, surgery, to try to correct the limbs is her only hope to

"Andrew aka ""Hollywood"" is a little boy I've known for years
  and provide occupational therapy services to every week. His family
  just got the news the past few days that it'd probably be best to have
  an early Christmas this year because recently Andrew's health has been
  deteriorating. This is absolutely heartbreaking for all involved. And
  despite all Andrew has been through, he still manages to show that
  beautiful smile that so many have grown to love. He's an adorable,
  fun, batman and superhero loving, sweet boy full of love and
  personality who has made a huge impact on so many lives in the short
  time he's been on this earth. The reason I wanted to start this
  donation page is because I know how very special, down to earth,
  friendly people Andrew and his family are. They take care of that boy
  so well and have provided Andrew with so much love, comfort, and
  support. They go above and beyond just to make sure he's happy. He
  definitely doesn't lack love. The only thing they've requested
  throughout this difficult time is Christmas cards for Andrew because
  he gets joy getting cards in the mail. They are not the type of family
  who would ever ask for anything from anyone, especially donations. So,
  that's why I am asking! Because if anyone deserves some kind of break
  and some kind of help, it is them. This would be especially helpful
  in covering some of the medical costs and help them that much more to
  be able to give Andrew a wonderful last Christmas, the best Christmas
  of his life! So, please donate! And if you also want to send a
  Christmas card, do that as well. The address you can send cards or even donations through the mail: 2017 Shela Blvd. Portsmouth, OH 45662 I truly and sincerely appreciate it and thank you so much! And I most
  definitely know they will too!","1,030",of $15k goal,https://fundrazr.com/513t3d,"Please donate for Andrew ""Hollywood"" Peck",22,,U.S. Dollar
"Hi everyone, My name is Jeffrey and I recently had major, life-saving heart
  surgery. A number of people encouraged me during my time leading up to
  surgery and during recovery. My family met various other families over
  the weeks spent in the hospital. Some family members had to sleep on
  waiting room chairs, and some even slept on floors, and this often
  went on for weeks. Many fathers and mothers had to leave at various
  times to work their jobs. Feeding family members and visitors that
  would come and go was a definite challenge. And attention given to
  siblings was often forgotten in the chaos of the moment. I would like to do everything possible to change these family
  experiences for the better. Dozens of teens right here in Dallas-Fort
  Worth have heart surgery every day! My vision is threefold: to help fund lodging in close proximity to
  the hospital for families in need, to help pay for meals and
  exhorbitant costs like parking, and to give small but meaningful gifts
  to family members that need a pick-me-up. The next step is to gather enough donations to present funds
    to our first 'Jeffrey Has Heart' subsidy recipient at our kickoff
    banquet, to be held in the first quarter of 2016. A promo
  video has been completed by a generous donation from a friend. You can see the video by clicking the picture above. Thank you for your generosity and 'take heart' that you have made a
  positive difference in a person's life. And for me, giving of
  yourself is what life is all about. Sincerely, Jeffrey Kelley","1,475",of $3k goal,https://fundrazr.com/814nB8,Jeffrey Has Heart,21,,U.S. Dollar

"I have saved hundreds of horses over the course of nine years. but
  trying to help save your son is an experience no one should have to
  endure. My son is mental handicapped and has had issues through out
  his whole life. His choices have not been always good, but as a
  parent, you try to always be there for them. My son has been hospitalized now for two weeks. He had been having
  major issues with his body, swelling, and not being able to move for
  weeks. He was tested for a stroke, no stroke...then the morning of
  being woke up from screams of pain..EMT and sheriff arrived and took
  him to hospital, But because he could not lay still for a catscan, the
  hosp discharged him. Next morning I went to judge for help, my son was
  literally dieing in front of my eyes, and I could not get him to go to
  doctors. When he was taken to hospital, he was admitted immediately.
  He had bacteria in his right lung. They immediately sedated him to
  help him be able to breath. The pain was horrific.  Two days later, he
  developed fluid around his right lung, so they started him on
  treatment. Two days later, left lung was effected, and more fluid
  around lungs between chest wall. Pneumonia set in. My son turned
  orange..they ran tests on liver, kidneys, levels acceptable.
  Medication is not working, so more tests. The fluid around his lungs
  is a thick paste blood mass. Procedure planned for this morning, they
  couldnt do it..Surgeon has been called in. Waiting for surgery time. I
  cannot help my son, I cannot save my son. I have been praying, there
  is a prayer line..THE ONLY THING I CAN DO.... IS BE THERE FOR HIM he
  is scared and doesnt understand what is happening...the hospital is an
  hour away. My car now knows the trip by itself. The expenses of being
  with your child in the hospital daily is high. I have been using my
  personal funds to drive back and forth, bringing him items he
  requires...eating at hosp to keep up my strength. I have been no stop,
  being in two places at one time. With my personal monies being spent
  on this life threatening matter, I really need help with the expenses
  it takes to keep Ohana operating. CAN  YOU PLEASE HELP ME AS I STAY BY

"My name is Elijah. I am a 25 year old weighing in at a whopping
  120lbs on a good day. A true heavy weight! Why? You might ask? I have
  Crohn's disease, and have since the age of eleven. Malnutrition and
  weight gain have always been a struggle for me, and when I have an
  exacerbation of my condition, even while on IV nutrition I can lose 5
  to 10lbs in a single week, which takes months to recuperate. I have had two surgeries since my diagnosis, as medications have, for
  the most part, failed me. My first was in 2010, and my second in 2014,
  where I was given an ileostomy bag. It saved my life at the time, but
  now I am looking to have the surgery reversed, and have the bag
  removed. There is only one problem: my weight. I am too thin to be
  safely operated on, and the only way I have ever gained the weight
  necessary for surgery has been my drinking upwards of (at least) 4x
  237mL Resource 2.0 (Vanilla) supplemental nutrition drinks. At 477
  calories per 237mL, that is nearly an extra 2000 calories per day. Due to the new laws and regulations in my province, I have no
  financial coverage for this item, and at the cost of over $400 per
  month, I simply cannot afford it, making surgery a distant dream.
  Working full-time is not an option for me and has always taken a toll
  on my health and landed me in the emergency room in a matter of weeks
  or months. My financial assistance will not cover this cost as it goes
  to put a roof over my head, as well as food and other regular expenses. So this is why I am here. I am due to have surgery in 2016, but not
  if I can't put on the weight to be safely operated on. I am looking
  for help to raise the funds necessary to help me pay for this
  supplemental nutrition, which will allow me to have the ileostomy
  reversal, and move on with my life. It is also an excellent
  post-operative nutritional solution as due to it's liquid form, it's
  easy on a newly-operated GI tract. $5,000 would cover a good eight
  months supply of the Resource 2.0 at six per day, so this is the goal
  I am setting. Every donation counts, and I am deeply appreciative from
  the bottom of my heart for every penny that goes into this campaign. If all goes well and I manage to raise enough for the drinks and go
  on to have the surgery, I will tell you where to look online to follow
  me and keep in touch during the days leading up to and following my
  surgery (likely Facebook and/or Twitter). I will post daily updates
  from my hospital room and let you all now how I am doing, thanks to you. Every penny of this campaign will go directly toward paying for the
  Nestle Resource 2.0 (Vanilla) supplemental nutrition drinks as well as
  any travel expenses incured in order to purchase and transport it back
  to my place. Thank you all sincerely, Wishing you the best of health, Elijah","1,724",of $5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/a13Ub9,Elijah's (IBD) Supplemental Nutrition Fundraiser,41,,Canadian Dollar
"I am Danielle the daughter of Mike Utley. I made this since my dad
  has lost his fight for his life. I would like to help by trying to
  raise some money to help with the cost that comes with this event, so
  no one will be worried about anything but grieving our loved one. My
  dad Mike Utley is only 49 years old. He was way to young for this to
  happen. A lil about my dad. He was in a bad car wreck about 15years
  ago, which has left him paralized and in a wheel chair, but hes never
  let that stop him from anything, even with that he would still get out
  and do the things that he loved, with it being harder physically for
  him but he never gave up. He was they type of person that even if he
  could do something then he would do it just to prove he could and the
  impossible was possible. He would help anyone and everyone with
  anything, he would have gave you the shirt off his back if you needed
  it. He loved to work on cars and he would get down out of his wheel
  chair and get under your car to fix it for you if you asked him to.
  Mike has been fighing for his life for the last 2 weeks, his heart
  hasn't been working or his lungs, this all happened after he had went
  to the Dr not feeling well, his oxyogen was low and they made him go
  to the emergency room where they admired him due to it being so low.
  Over night this had gotten so bad we had him life lined to a better
  hospital that was more equip with specialist for his heart and lungs.
  They had him with a vent tube so he could breath while sedated to
  sleep until his lungs got better, a week into this his kidneys were
  shutting down and the second week his lungs were failing. We are all
  very heart broke over this event. This event was brought on so sudden
  and unexpected. My Brother is trying to get everything in order to
  make arrangements for his funeral Service. Any help and prayers would
  be greatley appriciated by us and our family",130,of $3k goal,https://fundrazr.com/715TO8,Benifit for Mike Utley,3,,U.S. Dollar
"On December 12th I suffered a major heart attack. It was absolutely
  horrifying. I spent a week in the ICU and just got out 4 days ago. I
  had NO SYMPTOMS except extreme fatigue. No chest pains....nada. I
  called my best friend (who happens to be a nurse) and he rushed me to
  the hospital. I was in full cardio arrest by the time I arrived. They
  put two stents in the ventricles leading to the upper chamber of my
  heart. It was horrifying. I have decided to set aside a big part of my practice (as many of you
  know I am a professional counselor) to educating young men (and women)
  who often do not have the ""typical symptoms"" to never ignore
  them and to get help no matter what. I am teaming up with the American Heart Association to use their

  victims."" It was terrifying but I am so grateful for the

  place of your usual charity this year) could you possibly donate as
  much or as little as possible to this cause to get out the word to
  ""atypiclal victicms"" of heart attacks in conjunction with

  of a potentail heart attack? -Did you know that people under the age of 50 often have NO sign of a
  heart attack except extreme fatigue and some have NO symptoms whatsoever. I was one of the the lucky ones and was spared my life. 100% of the proceeds will go towards advertisting and getting the
  word out. I am also going to be running free groups and webinars and
  will not make any clients pay for any of this information. Thank you so much for your support! Whether it's $5 or $100 it would

"Follow Olives story of Facebook https://www.facebook.com/olivekikiwhite Olive is a four year old girl with a very rare undiagnosed condition.
  Olive faces many challenges but has a very special, independent and
  can do attitude to life and touches the heart of everyone she meets. Olive was born with one half of her body significantly smaller and
  weaker than the other. This has caused a variety of problems for Olive
  where one of her legs was much shorter and smaller than the other. It
  was clear she would not be able to walk and the Dr’s could not
  lengthen her bones as the difference was too great. It was necessary
  to amputate her right foot when she was 18 months old enabling her to
  walk using a prosthetic leg. Olive began to walk independently after
  her 2nd birthday. The knee to her small leg is positioned much higher
  than her other leg making actions like running and pedalling a normal
  bike impossible, so Olive skips and enjoys her scooter. Olive suffers from Scoliosis (curvature of the spine) due to the
  unequal sides of her body. This means she needs support from special
  needs chairs and a wheelchair to help support her and keep her spine
  as straight as possible. Olive has a smaller right hand and arm with
  some bone abnormalities which causes her difficulties in daily life.
  Olive has torticollis of her neck which causes her to hold her head to
  one side, which along with her asymmetry cause her to struggle with
  her balance and she tires extremely quickly. Olive was able to have a ride on a Tom Cat Trike, a special needs
  trike which is made and adapted for her needs. It enabled her for the
  very first time to cycle, much to our amazement and joy! Olive was
  able to sit safely, with her posture and spine supported, and
  adaptions have been made to accommodate her prosthetic leg and knee
  position. Not to mention she absolutely LOVED it!!! This trike comes with a parental control handle with a brake to keep
  her safe and take over when she gets tired. It also comes apart and
  connects to a bar so she can be towed behind an adult bike giving her
  the ability to get out with the whole family on bike rides. We are fundraising to get Olive a trike of her own giving her the joy
  and freedom to cycle like any other child. It will help to improve
  Olives strength, fitness and confidence and show her and other
  children that no matter what your difficulties in life they can be
  overcome and nothing can stop you achieving!","5,691",of £2.6k goal,https://fundrazr.com/e137K2,Please help us buy Olive a special needs trike,105,,Pound Sterling

  to have headaches and vomiting on the 16. On February 19, Brion
  started to loose his eyesite. The next day we went to a walk-in eye
  doctor. There they dialated his eye and found he had blood on the
  retinas. From there they sent us directly to an eye specialist that
  got us in right away. At the specialist they took pictures of his eyes and took his blood
  pressure. We met with the dr. for maybe ten minutes. He said there was
  nothing he could do for Brion since his blood pressure was so high. He
  told us to go directly to the hospital. That is exactly what we did. While at the ER, Brion's blood pressure was 225/137. He could have
  stoked out and died. They also found out that his kidneys were only
  functioning at 5%.  They admited him and put him in the CCU (ICU) for
  5 days. They ran many tests. That Saturday they drew 21 viles of blood
  just to find out what was going on. They continued to draw blood work
  everyday. They started a treatment of dialysis and plasma transfusions. It wasn't until a week later we found our Brion has a very rare blood
  disease. The diagnosis is (aHUS). Only 1 in every 500,000 people have
  this. There is no cure for it. He continues to be on dialysis three days a week. He is also having

  weeks and has changed to every other week.  His blood doctor is
  hopeful that the iv meds will work and he will regain function in his kidney. Not to mention he will be droppd from his Michigan insurance and had

"Hi we're Ben & Cassie, founders of Soul Fit NYC, a wellness
  company dedicated to creativity, self expression and healing for all
  people on the planet. Early this year our friend Richard Miller, a brilliant Brazilian
  guitarist approached us about a concern and idea he had to solve it.
  He told us a little known fact: over 60% of professional musicians are
  forced to end their careers early due to injury. Richard knows that it
  doesn't have to be that way. Rather than feeling sorry for himself and
  those affected by injury, he took action. He created an idea for a
  healing retreat in the healing land of Costa Rica, especially for
  guitarists. It's called ""Balanced Guitar."" It's a retreat
  that addresses injury prevention through balance. With yoga, surging,
  Tai Chi, massage, guitar instruction and healing food, Richard knows
  he could make a difference. We loved the idea! Like Richard, Cassie and I saw the possibility of
  this retreat and the huge  impact and possitive benefits this retreat
  could have for anyone who participated (musicians or not). We hit the
  ground running and made Richards dream a reality. This January 5th-13th, Balanced Guitar will happen in the healing
  land of Nosara, Costa Rice. Students from all walks of life and

"Jesenia and Luis Cintron knew from an ultrasound that their baby
  would be born with a hole in her heart and a defective heart
  valve. After her birth on May 5, 2008, baby Yasmine spent two
  weeks in a Florida hospital's neonatal Intensive care unit. In
  Ocotober 2008, they moved to Connecticut to be near family. Shortly
  after their move Yasmine went into respiratory distress and was rushed
  to the hospital by her parents. She was flown to Maria Fared
  Children's Hospital at Westchester Medical Center for further
  evaluation and specialized cardiac care. In Addition to Yasmine's
  heart defects, it was found she had been born with another rare
  condition called heterotaxy syndrome, a major defect resulting in
  having two right heart ventricles, instead of a right and a left,
  which greatly decreases effective heart pumping. From 2008 to 2013, pediatric cardiac specialists Markus Erb,
  M.D. and Suvro S. Sett, M.D. successfully performed several cardiac
  catheterizations and three major heart surgeries, respectively, to
  repair Yasmine's heart defects. Because of advances in cardiac diagnosis and treatments
  developed through research, Yasmine's heart defects were survivable
  but that struggle is not over yet. As she grows, the simple things we
  take for granted, going to Dentist and more surgeries require much
  more funds. As you can imagine the family has given every cent to her

"In December, 2012, our daughter was diagnosed with a pituitary brain
  tumor called craniopharyngioma.  She continues to fight this disease
  with humor, laughter, and a bravery from which we can all learn.  In
  January of 2013, Amalia underwent two separate surgeries to relieve
  pressure and remove fluid from the tumor, followed by six weeks of
  daily radiation therapy from March to May.  We hosted a very
  successful fundraiser in April, 2013, which covered the cost of all
  but about $20,000 of her medical bills.  For some of her ongoing
  treatment, we have chosen to seek a second opinion and are now seeing
  one of her physicians outside of our home state. ** As of November, 2015, we have completed our next round of tests
  and received the news that Amalia's pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, and
  ovaries are functioning abnormally.  After visiting with our
  endocrinologist and oncologist, we now know that the growth hormone
  injections will possibly last for Amalia's lifetime.  Additionally,
  she will start to receive several other hormones to help her body
  develop and grow.  It has been confirmed by several doctors that she
  will need these treatments for the rest of her life, that she will not
  be able to have children, that this may cause her tumor to grow, and
  that her vision will continue to be impacted by her treatments. This is not the news we were expecting; however, we are putting
    our faith in God to lead our family through this latest setback. Growth hormone injections and other therapies are extremely
  expensive!  Our health insurance will cover a portion of this
  treatment, but we will still be left with several hundred dollars per
  month in copays.  Because Amalia's MRI schedule will increase to every
  3 months, this will also raise our medical bills once again.  Our goal
  is to build a fund for Amalia that she can continue to draw from as
  she reaches adulthood.  Needless to say, this is all going to create a
  radical financial burden for us - and for her as she grows up and
  takes on the responsibility of providing for her own healthcare needs. At this time, we are making no plans to schedule a face-to-face
  fundraiser, so we continue to ask for your support through Fundrazr. We are also still selling gray wristbands to raise awareness of
  pediatric brain cancer and tumors.  Please contact us for information
  on how to purchase or assist with selling our wristbands. We appreciate your love and support as we move forward with Amalia's

"I am Elizabeth Stiles, a 2015 YPM parent.  As my daughter, Sister
  Catherine Stiles, served in Nauvoo, Illinois as a tuba player, a group
  of parents organized ourselves to share pictures, information and
  stories about our children and their service.  That's how I met Bill
  and Leanne Rostedt, parents of Elder Tyler Rostedt, a stage
  missionary.  As parents, we really hit it off, and we not only grew to
  love one another but one another's children.  When I visited Nauvoo I
  knew every one of the Elders and Sisters and cared about them because
  of our associations. The YPM's returned home in August.  Since that point, many parents
  have remained in contact.  That is how I learned that Elder Rostedt,
  who is half-way across the world from his parents, has a serious tumor
  at the base of his brain that requires urgent surgery.  As part of his
  YPM family, I feel compelled to reach out to other members of that
  family to help provide financial, physical and spiritual assistance to
  this endearing Aussie and his family. That's where you come in.  Many of you were his brothers and sisters
  for the months he served in Nauvoo.  Many were watching him from afar
  (via our Facebook group).  Others are part of a worldwide group of
  Missionary Mamas who were both receiving and providing regular updates
  on what the YPM's were up to this summer.  Still others were right
  there in Nauvoo, being entertained by him.  However you came to know
  Elder Rostedt, you came to love him.  As such, we are asking for your
  prayers and, when possible, monetary support. Elder Rostedt has brought joy and testimony to our lives.  Let us
  give back to him as the Lord would have us do.  We are asking that you
  give $5, $10, $25, or more so that he and his family can pay for
  travel, medical and recovery expenses, food, lodging, or whatever they
  need during this time.  As soon as we have collected our goal amount
  (and maybe before), we will forward the money to Brother Bill Rostedt,
  Tyler's father. Please give generously to protect and preserve this dear Elder's life
  and quality of living! Much Love, Sister Stiles PS We have had requests to extend well wishes via the mail.  For this

"Hi
  everyone, thank you for being here and helping me, I have no family to
  assist me and my children on this insane journey of a beast of a
  disease that does not want to go away! This is Sandy McClellan and as
  many of you know I have been battling cancer since Oct. 2012 when I
  was diagnosed with stage 3 invasive ductal carcinoma (HER2 +), I'm
  still fighting and I'm still here! After 8 rounds of chemo and a
  bilateral mastectomy things were better for awhile. But sadly my last
  PET scan (in the pic) shows malignancy, a NEW form of cancer
  (UPDATE....MASSES NOW FOUND ON OVARIES AS WELL) and I have been going
  through a lot of tests (labs tumor markers CT) and had lymph node
  surgery and an endoscopy and I'm nowhere near done. MEDICAID Fast
  Track Program for breast and cervical cancer will not approve tests
  and treatment for seperate secondary cancer as it is not related to my
  original diagnosis. As many of you also know I am a mom of 6 and I
  have been workin' hard and doing all I can to care for my family. It
  is HARD when you ar so exhausted, can't keep food down, and MUST KEEP
  GOING  to survive. My situation is this, I need more scans/tests,
  mostly a second PET, that my insurance will not cover and since this
  problem with carcinoma lies in the pancreatic area I cannot wait the
  18 months until my insurance will give approval to cover these scan.
  So although I have saved some of the cost I fall short and I need to
  find some supporters who would help with the amount I need to cover
  the medical costs so I can move on toward treatment. Supporting my
  family is a tight enough budget, able to cover most basic needs by
  scraping, and I just dont have the finances to cover these necessary
  expenses, and I cannot have the scan and procedures until they are
  paid for paid first. Any support is amazing, any bit will help and
  even if you can just spread it around that would be awesome! Thank you
  for supporting my fundraiser and I am soooo grateful I have survived

"Greetings. I am Simnara. I reside in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine and I apply to you
  for aid with this letter. In January 2014 Taras Sauta, my husband, 34 years, was diagnosed with
  acute monoblastic leukaemia (C 93.0). Taras needs allogeneic bone
  marrow transplantation form a donor. This surgery is impossible in
  Ukraine as well as immunogenotypic analysis (neither of the relatives
  suit in the matter of the age). Specialists recommend us to undertake
  this surgery in Germany or Israel. We negotiated with clinics in both
  countries. Germany presented us with a bill of 289 596 euros, while
  Israel sent us a bill of 162 038 USD + 20 000 USD for possible
  complications that may arise during the operation (in case there are
  no complications, this additional amount shall be returned). Based on
  the results we have chosen Israel. In May 2015 we visited Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in Israel for
  professional consultation. Taras underwent medical tests to find an
  appropriate donor and start working with him/her (10 000 euros). Thus,
  we passed the first stage. The doctors confirmed the necessity of bone
  marrow transplantation. Since our family is completely underfunded, we
  cannot pay for the surgery. Due to the current situation Taras was
  recommended to undertake a course of light chemotherapy to strengthen
  remission. We have undertaken 7 courses already: 2 maintenance chemotherapy courses in the frames of 7+3 program in
  February 2014 (remission was reached); 2 therapy courses with cytosar
  in high doses; January 2015 – disease recurrence; 2 maintenance
  chemotherapy courses NAM with alexan and mitoxantrone in high doses
  (second remission was reached); 1 therapy course with cytosar in high
  doses. Currently the period of the after-treatment is lasting. We invested our own funds in Taras’s treatment before, but now we
  have to ask for financial aid from aside, since we cannot cover the
  costs on surgery by ourselves. We applied to the Ukrainian charity
  funds, but they cannot help us. In the first turn they provide
  financial support to underage children, young people under 26 years
  and those involved in the armed conflict at the East of Ukraine. In
  addition, the sum is extremely huge. Many funds have never faced such
  amounts of money. Besides, we ask for help through the Ukrainian mass
  media. Local TV channels help us by showing video about Taras:

"My name is Karen, a childhood friend of Sharon Roloff who is the
  bravest, strongest, and most amazing person I know. In December 2012
  Sharon heard the words that we all dread, ""You have a very rare
  form of bone cancer called Osteosarcoma"". Since then Sharon has
  undergone very strong chemo treatments that required 2-3 days of
  hospitalization, and had a mega prosthesis which was done to remove
  the tumor in her shin. The battle has been long and Sharon has been
  fortunate to work at home while undergoing these dreadful chemo
  treatments. She went into a short remission, however on December 1,
  2015 she received some terrible news. The chemo quit working and the
  original ten tumors had gotten larger. To make matters worse, the
  scans showed 10 more ""hot spots"" (tumors) that had spread to
  more bones including her skull. Through all this terrible news, Sharon
  continues to remain optimistic and continues to fight this battle with
  her unbelievable strength and courage. Sharon visited MD Andersen in
  Jacksonville, Florida to discuss her options to continue this battle.
  The doctor informed her that her treatment options are limited at this
  point. He also told her the cancer will eventually spread to her
  organs, her bones will deteriorate and she will become immobilized.
  Sharon has decided to undergo the original chemo treatments that she
  had when she was first diagnosed in December 2012. The problem is this
  chemo is so strong that she can only receive it for 3-6 months and
  will have to be hospitalized for 2-3 days every 3 weeks. This chemo
  makes Sharon very ill and she will be losing 1 week of pay every 3

  this treatment, she would be able to do so many more things she longs
  to do with her family. The money will be spent for travelling to Serbia for Bone Marrow Stem
  Cell treatment. The programme lasts for twelve days which includes
  tests, preparations and treatment from Stem Cell specialist. The cost
  of the entire process is £15,000. We are hopeful that this treatment will take immediate effect,
  however small. The outcome however is unsure as there is no current
  cure for Multiple Scelosis but the stem cell treatment will hopefully
  repair damaged nerves which will improve everyday tasks and give
  Claire back some of her independence. There is no cure for MS yet, but
  treatments like this can give sufferers hope and help. We are going to raise these funds by doing different fundraising
  events...Our first being 'Walk A Mile In Claire's Shoes' (a sponsored

"On 1-19-16 our son was born, weighing 10lbs 15oz at home with no
  complications in only 6 hours thanks to being in comfortable setting
  and the expertise of our amazing midwife Augustine. Insurance said it
  couldn't be done but we knew it could!!  We knew because I'd already
  delivered a healthy 10lb 2oz baby at home three years before. They denied our coverage because they insisted that I didn't know my
  body as well as a stranger in Salem who was more motivated by
  political agenda than what is right for the patient. Homebirths cost
  tax payers $4000 roughly and hospital births are close to $30,000. Our midwife has been generous enough to stretch out payments but we

"Hi, I'm Rachael and I'm 18 years old.  I suffer from a rare genetic
  disease called Ehlers Danlos syndrome.  Not many people have heard of
  it but the effects are debilitating.  So, what does it do to me?? Well, I constantly dislocate ALL joints including ribs &
  knuckles(umm excruciatingly painful & I'm on a bucketload of
  expensive meds to help control pain), my bladder no longer works
  (won't go into details about what I've gotta do to manage that!), my
  bowel no longer works (yup, I've just had a colostomy bag fitted).  I
  often faint for no apparent reason and have fits.  Yeah.... not a lot
  of fun and rather cramps my style but staying positive is my aim
  and raising awareness & a cure is my ultimate goal. Soooo, when I'm not exhausted by pain & no sleep I keep a blog
  called ""Rachaels Health Journey""
  http://rachaelshealthjourney.blogspot.com.au , I speak at places like
  Rotary (exhausting but I love it) and help other children with
  disabilities by doing some part time work (when I am able) for the
  Save the Children Fund. My mother is my carer and together we battle this debilitating
  disease and try to remain positive as each obstacle arises. So, what am I raising money for??  I am constantly dislocating my
  ribs when I try to get out of bed to change my colostomy bag.  An
  electric bed will support my body to sitting position so I can ease
  myself out without causing further injury to myself. A suitable electric bed costs around AUD$2000.  This is beyond the
  reach of my mothers Australian Carer's or my disability allowance.  I
  appreciate that we are supported in this way but trying to get $2000
  together is where I'm asking for your support and care. I really appreciate any donation whatsoever, all of which will assist
  me lead the most fulfilling life that I am able. Thank you so much for your support. Rachael Ralston.","3,465",of $2k goal,https://fundrazr.com/915lE5,Please help brave Rach purchase an electric bed.,43,,Australian Dollar
"As a parent I never imagined ever having to write a story like this
  about my child. You always read about horrible stories but until your living through
  it you truly don't understand how horrific it is not being able to
  save your child. Kayla was born a healthy beautiful little girl always smiling always
  full of life. Never sick until this year 2014 just the run of the mill viruses
  colds and bugs nothing too serious. Shortly just before school had ended for the summer kayla fell ill
  with a high temperature nothing too outrageous just a slight high one
  after 3 days she had flu like symptoms at the time there was an awful
  summer flu going around, we put it down to being that. She then was feeling much better and decided she wanted to go to my
  parents for a sleepover. That weekend she was due to go to a party but refused to leave my
  parents my mum said she was a little off and maybe wasn't up to it
  little did I know making the decision to let her stay again in my
  parents saved her life. Only after having a new baby I'd falling asleep on the couch that
  Saturday night I woke Sunday morning at 4 to my dad ringing me that
  call il never forget hearing my dad say kayla was having a seizure in
  her sleep choking on her vomit. Thankfully my mum had slept beside kayla and woke to her, if kayla
  had been home she would have been asleep on her top bunk and I
  wouldn't have heard her to hear the doctor tell you if that would have
  happened kayla wouldn't be with us now is horrendous. I followed my parents to a&e she was admitted straight away I let
  my parents go home that morning 10mins later I witnessed the most
  horrific sight I'd ever seen my baby my precious little 6yr old having
  a horrendous seizure like something from a horror film I begged the
  doctors and nurses to save my little angel How could this happen to her a normal healthy  child what was wrong! As the hours went by I didn't leave her bedside watching her like I
  did as a newborn waiting for any sign of more slowing they had been
  hours apart to then going mins apart days later all the tests they
  could do and most coming clear they couldn't find what was causing
  these horrific seizures they treated her for everything from
  meningitis to infection in the brain after several days we were
  transferred to icu in Crumlin kaylas condition worsened she was in
  full status this is where seizures are completely out of control and
  your unable to come out of them..Their only option was to put kayla in
  an induced coma she was intubated and spent another few days lifeless. Our nightmare was only beginning all kaylas tests where coming back
  clear scans of the brains eeg's mri's ct's everything doctors couldn't
  understand that was was causing these even in the sedation she was
  still having them. After days of this I needed a break and went home to my parents to
  spend some time with our two year old and newborn little did I know
  kaylas dad was by her side being told by her consultant she didn't
  think kayla would make it past the weekend but no to tell me as I was
  only after having a baby it would be too upsetting. I only found this out two last week how serious they thought it had
  been they were thinking brain disease , acute brain infections
  ,bacterial encephalitis every name mentioned I felt my heart break
  ..This had to be a bad dream. After three weeks it was time to wake kayla up they slowly began
  waking her unfortunately she started having them again and went back
  into sedation..We were told she may be seriously affected by th
  damaged that happened during status. Finally doctors had an answer what was causing all this they went
  back studied kaylas mri's in detail and found she had been born with a
  slight brain defect called cortical dysplasia a thickening of the grey
  mater of one of the lobes on her left hand side affecting her right
  this part of the brain controls memory and speech. Kayla was born with this we would have never of known but
  unfortunately it was like a dormant volcano waiting for something to
  trigger it ...that trigger was two viruses that had triggered that
  defect to cause epilepsy. We had answers. .finally Never having any knowledge of epilepsy I just thought it was
  something you have and you take medication and your fine..how wrong
  was I epilepsy is a horrendous disease it can affect anybody at
  anytime it doesn't have to be in the family it can be brought on by anything. I never knew epilepsy can be fatal. It's horrific how there isn't
  more awareness. Epilepsy nearly killed my daughter she's had to learn to walk talk
  and eat again she's still not herself but hopefully over time we will
  get her back she's on horrendous amounts of medication as most
  medications she doesn't respond to I watched my babygirl hallucinating
  terrified to her core of sitting in a chair I held my child while she
  went through hundreds of siezures I watched my healthy energetic full
  of life child have everything taken from her. Slowly she started to improve with physiotherapy  OT and speech
  therapy. My baby had wasted away always being very slight she had lost
  a further stone wasting away over the weeks she had no strength we
  were eventually moved to a ward 4 days down kayla was doing great
  until our nightmare returned kayla slipped back into status back in
  icu my heart sank "" I begged god that evening to not let her go
  back to where she was I hadn't the strength to cope how could I watch
  her lay there again not knowing..but kayla wouldn't let that happen
  doctors wrong again she came back fighting and after two days was back
  to a ward again one siezure in two days it's been amazing she's
  started walking again talking everything my baby defeated this
  horrific dream she's fighting through it everyday determined she can
  do it all! Now as we now know kayla will always have a very aggressive form of
  epilepsy and it will be a long and hard road all I want for her is to
  have a normal independent life we can't always be there watching
  everything our worry is she could have a siezure at any time and time
  is everything with siezures I'm terrified of her sleeping at night
  alone or out playing how can I be there every minute I'm asking people
  if they could donate as little as you can to help us raise funds to
  get kayla a siezures alert dog. These dogs are trained to be alerted of siezures even before they
  happen and can alert us or someone near by if kayla is in trouble also
  they are trained to lie on her to keep her from harm if she's mid
  siezure they can alert us during the night if she had taken one while
  sleeping having this dog could potentially safe kayla at a time when
  we are not around or keep her safe during one. All we want as parents is for this horrific disease to never hold her
  back to let her have a normal childhood safely I thank anyone who can help from the bottom of my

"Steven is a husband and father of 5. He became ill Valentines of 2012
  when a heart attack put him in CICU. We did not see this coming. Steve
  was a fit, visably healthy guy who worked 12 hours a day and often 7
  days a week at Eaton's Belmond factory. He was in the middle of a 12
  hour shift when he started to feel ill and went to lie down in the
  conference room. He made the decision to drive home and we took him to
  the local Emergency room that evening. Unfortunately, they sent him
  home with a diagnosis of back pain. He did not have the classic heart
  attack symptoms and he was having a very specific type of heart attack
  that dos not show up on an EKG. This meant that Steven spent the next
  2 days suffering and I finally convinced him to allow me to take him
  to another hospital in a larger city. Within 5 minutes he was rushed
  to a major cardiac center.That is when our journey began. Testing
  revealed an aortic aneurysm, 90% blockage of the ""widow
  maker"" in his heart along with 2 other 100% blockages. Steve
  narrowly escaped the loss of his leg which was also suffering a 100%
  block and being supplied blood from an artery which had grown a
  collateral from his brachial artery in his arm all the way down to his
  leg. The only thing that saved him that saved him and his leg that
  evening is the fact that the surgeon decided he would stint him
  immediately and run tests due to the fact that he believed Steven had
  suffered repeated heart attacks over the previous few days. Due to the aortic aneurysm we learned that Steven could no longer
  lift more than a gallon of milk which certainly ruled out returning to
  Eaton. We also learned that his best option for extending his life and
  keeping his leg is to have a bifemoral aortic bypass and removal of
  the aneurysm. This surgery replaces the arteries which branch off of
  the aorta and feed blood to the legs with artificial arteries and
  removing the aneurysm entails a great amount of blood loss and is
  difficult due tothe position on the aorta. We opted to monitor the
  aneurysm for a time. Rupture of the aneurysm is almost certainly fatal
  but the surgery is extremely high risk as well. The bifemoral bypass
  is also risky, with one in five dying on the table and a fairly high
  post-operative mortality rate as well. The time has come however for
  us to make the hard choices.The bypass will leave him on a ventilator
  for at least 5 days post op and recovery is a long one requiring many
  days of travel and therapy both pre and post op. The process has left
  the family with many financial burdens. Although insurance covers some of Steven's cost it does not cover all
  of it, nor does it cover travel or make up for the lost income when
  trying to maintain the home. Anything helps even 1$ helps and we are

  his condition is being managed with many costly medications, however
  dialysis is in his future, as well as a kidney transplant when he is
  big enough. His condition may also affect other areas of his life,

  water down, and I felt like I was having contractions. Even though we
  knew it would be expensive, I had to go to the Emergency Room. We were
  there for about 6 hours; I was on a morphine and saline drip because
  they hoped I could pass it there. After a CT scan, they told me I have

  lifesaving surgery, they had to send me home. I have enough
  anti-nausea medicine and pain pills to go a few more days, but then I
  will have to go back to the ER and do it all over again- which is very expensive. If we meet the goal with the money I am fundraising, I will be able

"There are lots of words to describe Ben--hard working, funny, caring,
  tough, supportive, and...stubborn. The thought of asking others for
  help in this situation is not an easy one for Ben, but his
  stubbornness is no match for the persistence of his siblings Ryan,
  Keagan, Austann, and Samantha (along with countless other friends and
  family members!) who are eager to help Ben and his family with his
  fight against cancer and the many, many expenses occurred between
  surgery, labs and tests, chemotherapy, and months of missed work.
  Cancer already took one beloved family member from the Abbott family
  when their mother Dawn passed away in 2000, and if this family has
  anything to do with it, it will NOT be taking another. Please read Ben's story and consider helping if you're able: Ben and his wife, Jackie, are 2005 graduates of DeSoto High School.
  The two started dating their junior year and got married in
  2009--exactly 5 years to the day after they started dating back in
  high school. Their oldest daughter, Allison, was born November 2009
  followed by the only boy, Colton, who was born March of 2012. The
  family welcomed their little firecracker, Brooklynn, just over 3
  months ago, on the 4th of July! Just 2 months after Brooklynn's birth, Ben grudgingly visited the
  doctor due to an injury he sustained at work. While there, testing
  resulted in the scary news that he might have cancer. Ben had surgery
  on September 9th to remove a tumor and initial results proved that the
  tumor had indeed been cancer, but it seemed hopeful that it had not
  spread. Despite hoping and praying, results came back a couple of
  weeks later that the cancer was not gone and it was actually worse
  than we had hoped. Ben was diagnosed with testicular, nonseminoma
  embryonal carcinoma. Quite the mouthful. This type of cancer is
  difficult to detect in normal scans which is why it took everyone by
  surprise. Embryonal carcinoma are more rare and are known to grow
  rapidly and to spread. After weighing treatment options and getting
  second opinions, Ben will be starting chemotherapy on October 19th
  which will run for 1 month. It is unknown what will happen after the
  first round of treatment, though any options are putting Ben out of
  work for the near future. Next steps may be an additional round of
  chemo. Another treatment option for this type of cancer is called
  ""retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)""--a major
  surgery in which the lymph nodes are removed. We are hopeful that the
  chemo will take care of Ben's cancer and the surgery will be
  unnecessary. The chemo, recovery, and financial strain of being out of
  work are enough to worry about at this point! Thank you for reading this story. Please keep Ben, his wife, and
  their children in your thoughts and prayers. If you're able to donate
  in order to help with Ben's missed work and medical expenses piling
  up, we would be eternally grateful. Sincerely, The Abbott Family","8,580",of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/513OM7,Benjamins for Benjamin: Help Ben Kick Cancer,109,,U.S. Dollar

  His heart went into arrest, and his wife Lora preformed CPR on him,
  saving his life. The parametics had to shock him twice.. He was taken
  to Samaritan Hospital, and about 45 minutes later was life flighted to
  Grant Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. On Monday evening they began a
  hypothermia/ cooling treatment to prevent any brain damage that may
  have previously may have happened from the heart arrest. Tuesday
  afternoon they began the warming of his body process which took about
  6 hours, they also began go to give him nutrition that night.
  Wednesday morning the kidney doctor came in to tell us that he had
  some damage to the kidneys from them shocking him, which usually
  happens. The doctor said that the main thing we need to focus on is
  his heart, and the kidneys we will handle later. Wednesday afternoon,
  was super exciting! For about an hour off and on, his eyes were open,
  he was answering yes and no to us, he squeezed our hands, wiggled his
  toes and even gave us a thumbs up!! All of his levels were looking
  great, and it was one good thing after another. Thursday morning we
  were told that he may have to be put on kidney dialysis temporarily to
  strengthen them. At 4:30 on Thursday he had his heart cath. His
  results came back as a weak heart muscle. He doesn't have an blockage
  in the heart. However, he will need to have a defibulator. He will
  also have to be on medication to strenghten his heart. Friday morning,
  the doctors started a process called Laxis Strips. Dad had fluid in
  his lungs and they want to get rid of the fluid. Also, he may need to

"I am Kay, Debby Woods cousin. I wanted a way for our family and
  friends to come together and support the Wood family and in turn raise
  awareness for the condition Scleroderma. Kevin was diagnosed with a
  rare form of Scleroderma just over a year ago. Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease that affects the
    skin and other major internal organs. It is an autoimmune condition, involving the overproduction of
  collagen and blood vessel damage. Excess collagen is laid down in
  these organs, which in turn results in scarring and reduced normal
  function of the affected organs. Scleroderma can be life-threatening as the skin, joints, tendons, and
  parts of internal organs can all be affected. Autoimmune conditions occur when the body’s tissues are attacked by
  its own immune system. Around 12,000 people in the UK have been diagnosed with scleroderma,
  with women affected four times as often as men .
  However, the complex nature of the condition can often lead to misdiagnosis. The onset of scleroderma is most frequent between the ages of
    25 to 55 but it may affect any age group, from children to
  the older generations. The exact cause or causes are still unknown . Factors
  other than gender, such as race and ethnic background, may influence
  the risk of developing scleroderma, as well as the age of onset, and
  the pattern or severity of internal organ involvement. Unfortunately Kevin is experiencing symptoms from both localised
  scleroderma and systemic sclerosis. More details of the condition can be found on www.sclerodermauk.org and http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/scleroderma The Wood family are a proud and fun-loving family, who will do
  anything for anyone. Kevin has a bucket list of places he wants to
  visit as a family and this is our way of supporting them in making
  cherised memories together. We all wish we could do more for them but
  we hope they will be able to use this money to enjoy their time
  together however they wish to do so. We hope to use this page as a platform for future fundraising in aid
  of The Scleroderma Society. Helping them in their research and to help
  support other families who may need it. Please help us to help them make some lasting memories. Any donation recieved will be greatly appreciated. Kay and family xx Unfortunately since starting this campaign Kevin has since lost his
  battle to scleroderma, and his family remain devastated. Funds raised prior to kevins passing were used to buy a mobility
  scooter, so that on his good days he could get out of the house for
  some fresh air, sadly Kevin only got to use this once. All funds donated from now will be used to raise awareness of this
  terrible life threatening disease. We will be helping the very
  worthwhile chairty ""Scleroderma Society"", by donating the
  money raised. ABOUT SCLERODERMA SOCIETY: ""We are the Scleroderma Society, a leading UK charity dedicated
  to supporting diagnosed individuals and their families whilst actively
  raising awareness, challenging decision-makers and funding research.
  Scleroderma can be a devastating disease not only to the individual
  diagnosed but also to family and friends. Scleroderma is a rare
  autoimmune condition which involves the overproduction of collagen.
  This is deposited in the body’s tissues causing hardening and scarring
  of the skin and internal organs. ‘Normal’ life can become struggle and
  the simplest of tasks can become impossible as the condition reduces
  normal function of affected areas. Scleroderma has no cure and can
  lead to physical disability or even death. We make living with
  scleroderma manageable by offering much needed support to diagnosed
  individuals but also to their families, carers and friends. Our
  services include a free support helpline, a network of local support
  contacts across the UK, an online discussion forum, an annual
  conference, an informative quarterly newsletter and an extensive range
  of literature on scleroderma.""","1,320",of £2k goal,https://fundrazr.com/c13Osc,Support the Woodys and Raise Scleroderma Awareness,48,,Pound Sterling
"Over the past 18 months my life's changed forever. On the 3rd August
  2013, I got stung in the chest by a Wasp & was left fighting for
  my life as I had several life threatening allergic anaphylactic
  reactions. I have had health problems leading up to this event but
  have somehow managed to live life to the maximum despite them. I have
  significant kidney and urological problems, Crohn's disease, Auto
  immune neutrapaenia (which affects my ability to fight infection),
  iron deficiant anaemia, an inherited heart condition, a stoma and
  urinary diversion, & I lost the sight in my left eye following a
  head injury. I am a national cyclist & despite all the health problems have
  been able to compete against others who were in full health & who
  weren't aware that I had any health problems. During the past 18months since being stung, I have had significant
  health problems. I have been left with further renal & urology
  problems, my immune system has been hugely affected & I have had
  numerous serious infections that I have struggled at times to beat.
  Since January 2014, I have had 14 episodes of Shingles in my inner
  ear, face, mouth, eye, scalp, neck, shoulder & the excrutiating
  pain that goes with it. I have needed surgery on my bladder &
  stoma & more recently it has been found that my central nervous
  system has started to shut down as the brain is seeing all the health
  problems & pain as a threat & in an attempt to protect itself
  has shut down, affecting my sensory, motor, & thermal nerve
  pathways, preventing me from doing things like being able to walk
  properly or stop severe pain. I have been diagnosed with two
  conditions, one called Central Sensitisation and the other Complex
  Regional Pain Syndrome. http://www.news-medical.net/news/20160325/CRPS-rank-higher-on-pain-scales-than-childbirth-cancer-amputation.aspx This won't get better & the prognosis is for better management

  aim. I will need a motorised wheelchair to give me full independence
  & not rely on others to push me at times as I have to in the
  current chair. I am looking to get the BOMA 7 wheel chair. It is
  motorised but also is great to go off road which would mean I could

  choices that are available. l believe, with the increasing aging population and the pressures of
  life's challenges, that accessability to Natural Therapies must be

  entire infusion therapy and chemotherapy drugs should be dosed
  accurately and precisely introduced during for a certain period of
  time: 1 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, a day ... The effectiveness and
  tolerability of drugs directly depends on the speed of
  introduction. Infusion pump is very important component of
  treatment. Without infusion pump there is no possibility to carry
  out high-precision infusions, which means not to have possibility of
  the effective treatment of leukemia and other oncological diseases at children. Mobile tripod for infusion pump is also very important for children,
  as only in this case, the child can move, do something pleasurable and
  not hung on to the hospital bed. The mood of the child - is also
  a step towards recovery. The department is currently being treated 25 children, suffering from
  diseases such as leukemia and lymphoma. Their future depends on
  whether the treatment is effective. It is difficult to estimate
  the value of this equipment in the treatment of children with
  oncological diseases. Making all possible conditions for
  obtaining a complete long-term remission, and therefore recovery
  - is the primary task of the Association ""VIATĂ FĂRĂ

"Samuel lost his battle on 22nd Jan 2014 to a very rare form of
  cancer, Precursor Non-Hodgkins T-Cell Lymphoma. During his time in hospital he went been through a lot - too much
  pain to think of and a vast amount of different medicines and their
  side effects. Through all this Samuel has been an inspiration to those around him,
  his courage and personality were phenomenal. During the pain, the endless medicine and horrible side effects, the
  loneliness he felt and my dispair at watching him slowly fade Samuel
  had the compassion to worry about the other kids going through hell.
  He started this charity to help others kids and their families when
  they need it the most; when they are very ill, scared, in pain, lonely
  and sometimes terminally ill. What does your donations and support do? Pain reducing equipment like
  the Accuveins we supplied make injections and cannulations much less
  painful and done on the first attempt (a huge thing as it often took 4
  attempts for Samuel). Free WiFi, Netflixs, games, computers - this is
  just a few of the things we supply to help along with support for
  parents and their families. We replace sofabeds - without them parents
  can't get a decent nights sleep (IF they get a chance - really ill
  kids are often up frequently, especially for medicine, being sick etc). A parent is part of the care team looking after a child - they are
  there all the time, giving medicine and looking out for changes in
  behaviour, if the medicine is working, side effects and general
  'looking after' duties. This takes a toll over weeks and months and to
  make sure the kids get the best care the parents need sleep! Plus, one
  of the most calming and natural things is for a child to sleep with a
  parent when they are scared, in pain or sad. Samuel saw how bad the food was and, with the help of some key people
  at the hospital, managed get the hospital to improve the menu and
  quality of the service. It took 18 months and I am very sad he never
  got to see just how much of a difference this one thing made. There
  are hundreds of things, big and small, that we can do to imrove the
  lives of these sick children and we are working to help more and more
  kids at more hospitals in the UK. Without you None of this is possible without your support. You have
  already touched and improved the lives of over 13,000 children each

"Please read my story, but first I will introduce myself. My name is Ronald Westerveld and I am called Ron. I have 2
  bleeding diseases what have had a tremendous impact on my life and
  even almost killed me a few times. But I am lucky, lucky that
  they found out that I am a so called bleeder, when I was 7 years old.
  I have been misdiagnosed twice. When I was 7 & 11 years young,
  finally when I was 15 they diagnosed me with not 1 but 2 blood diseases. There are a lot of people in the world who do not have that
  much luck. If they didn't diagnosed me as a bleeder just before my
  tonsils extraction, I would have drown in my own blood. In 2008 they
  finally could extract them with new developed medication. And that
  improved my health tremendously. But still a lot of people in the developed countries and
  undeveloped countries have not that much luck and do die. For me that
  is not acceptable. Now I am looking for the funds that I lack to earn money to donate
  for 100% to professor Leebeek. My haematologist who is treating me for
  about 15 years as the professor before him was retiring. The Erasmus
  MC in Rotterdam, The Netherlands is treating me since my 15th year.
  And I want to do something back, because they saved my life a few
  times since then. I have bought in 2014 a sailboat which should be seaworthy, but is
  not. So I went to the original wharf and designer of my “Waarschip
  725” for a restauration. Safety comes first, I am trying to get a
  satellite internet connection sponsored. And the company I have asked
  for it is now looking in to it. But what I lack and do not have the funds for myself are: Solar panels Batteries to store the solar power An internet connection by satellite Auto-pilot Crossbow (building it myself, at least I try to and I am
    quite positive since I            have better equipment as they did in the dark ages when they
    used it in warfare). Sea fishing rods and gear Desalination machine to make my own drinkable water. And that is why I need a crowdfunding platform to raise € 30.000,-. What will I do for the earth’s population, since this is a global
  problem: Even in western countries does not everybody has excess
  to a Haematology Treatment Centre and does not all the hospitals have
  the expertise in recognizing these diseases. So you can imagine that
  in undeveloped countries with a less well developed health care people
  are not recognised as being a “bleeder” or is the awareness how to
  recognise the symptoms. That is why I want to sail along the earth’s coastlines and meet the
  indigenous people who live in far and remote places and make a daily
  documentary which I will broadcast on YouTube to earn revenue that
  will be solely be used for Research, Development of better medication
  and Education of medical staff on a global scale. When I am broadcasting this adventure / documentary I will attract
  (seek actively) the publicity some of the television programmes in The
  Netherlands to get the first coverage on television. As I am getting
  this attention I can use this to attract the local media in the
  countries which I will be sail in to create “Awareness”. Awareness is
  already a huge win, as the doctors will be getting aware so is the
  general public in cities and villages in those countries. My goal is that I will save lives of people because of the awareness,
  and hopefully earn enough money with my YouTube Broadcasts to donate
  and help in creating better medication or even better a cure in the
  form of gene therapy. Because it is a fault in our genes that is
  creating this. Estimated 1 or 2 % of the earth’s population has a bleeding disorder
  and still in western countries people are getting diagnosed later in
  life. And again in undeveloped countries this is an even greater problem. I just need some help in raising these funds, and I will try to get
  these things sponsored as well. Everything I can get sponsored will
  lower the maximum amount of the € 30.000, - I need and mentioned
  before. But I have learned in my life never to bet on one horse. And this is not a once in a life time adventure, as my ship needs a
  minimum depth of just 1 metre / 3 feet and a few inches I can travel
  up rivers and canals in a later stage in my exploration of the world
  and earning money to donate. I am 41 years old so I can do this for the next 30 years at least,
  and what I really want to do. I have not got a wife or
  girlfriend or children or other family, and I really want to make a
  change in the world without profiting from it. I do not give anything
  about money, experiences and stories are worth more than all the money
  in the world. And if I can safe just one life in 30 years I have won.
  But the chances of saving hundreds of lives just by awareness alone is
  more likely. I can only hope there are people who still care about people they do
  not know and had not the luck to be born in a well-educated country,
  like me and I guess like you too. The amount is not that great, but great enough for me to cuff up,
  that is why I need your help. I have bought the ship last year, it is
  getting restored as we speak. If you want to see, know and wants to get informed in what I am doing
  and already have done as well to see pictures of the restauration.

  destination of the money has changed and I had to think of how I could
  attract media attention because that is a great win by itself. I hope you will see how big the problem is and you can also checkout
  the World Federation of Haemophilia who resides in Canada. And is
  found with the following URL http://www.wfh.org/en/page.aspx?pid=492 As you will see there are “more” people with a bleeding disorder in
  the educated world as in the undeveloped world. And believing in the
  fact that in the undeveloped world the citizens have a better
  healthcare is not reality. Please inform yourself and you will see as I did that this is a
  global problem as von Willebrand Disease is the most common disease it
  is a great starting point to address first. You can find a few
  communities who are doing the same as I do only just for their selves,
  and I think bigger and of the undiagnosed people with a bleeding
  disorder. That is why I need you to help me helping the global population. Thank you for your attention and if you do not fund me, but you did
  get aware. I have already had a small win but I want to make a
  difference as you will see when you do your research in my plan. And
  you will, that is just normal at least I should investigate someone
  before I would fund him/her. And I can only hope you will help me to do this safely as possible as
  I am also planning this with my physician. And I will set sail in
  2017, I am determined to make this possible. I have had my yearly check-up at the 29th of September 2015. I have a
  letter of proof that professor Leebeek knows, he will be sponsored in
  his research as the pharmaceutical industry doesn’t do it, so the
  academically hospitals will have to do it. And my hospital is just that. Check Hemophilia on Wikipedia and compare it with the following link. And you will see how big of a problem this is! http://www.wfh.org/en/abd/carriers/carriers-and-women-with-hemophilia-en 1 of every 10.000 people have von Willebrand Factor / von Willebrand
  Disease in a problematic way. Otherwise 1 or 2% has this problem
  without knowing. 1 of every 30.000 people have haemophilia. And then we have still different kinds of blood disease who have all
  the effect of getting immobilisation or even death of all those people. If we have 7 billion people in the world we are talking about
  millions of people of whom 75% doesn't have the proper treatment or
  access to treatment at all. If a natural disaster happens the charities are lined up. And
  we, we have to do it ourselves. Please help me help all of them
  who uses 2 year old expired medications (blood derives) or for those
  who have no access to medication at all. Save unnecessary deaths or immobilized people. I am loosing money with a smile, I will never get a penny back for
  what I am doing. This is how important this is for me as I care about
  other people without my luck of having great professors to give me my treatment. Just a selfless act of just someone to bring the awareness to the
  people like the priests did hundreds of years ago. I just need to get
  started safely. If I can't raise the money I need, I am setting
  sail in July as this has to happen. But it will decrease my chances of
  surviving this. I will bet my life on it because this has to be done! Want to fact check this statement You can find it here: http://www.wfh.org","19,282",of €30k goal,https://fundrazr.com/5137Ca,Global awareness for bleeding disorders and more.,7,,Euro
"My name is Graeme McCreath. I became blind from glaucoma and
  secondary ophthalmitis at age nine. Click here to listen to the Youtube video on
    the issue as told by another blind person in the UK. In the photo is my old guide dog Adrienne , recently
  retired, and the dog at the heart of my story. I was out with friends at a restaurant in the summer of 2014. At the
  end of the evening one of the party called for a taxi. When the taxi
  arrived the driver refused Adrienne, saying ""Can't take the
  dog"" with no other explanation.   I was hurt and publicly
  humiliated as this occured on a busy city street. Closed Caption Description of Cartoon : in case
    you cannot see the cartoon below : it is a typical 3 part cartoon
    strip in B&W. On the left you see three people and a dog waiting
    for a taxi - the blind person is holding up a card with word
    ""taxi"" above his head. There is also a taxi stand sign.
    The middle image shows a taxi arriving. The people cannot be seen as
    they are now behind the taxi. The blind person's arm holding the
    sign is still visible. The third image is the punch-line. The taxi
    is gone in a puff of smoke, the two seeing people are also
    surprisingly gone. They obviously have jumped the queue. The
    seeing-eye dog is saying to himself (in a bubble above his head)
      "" Wow! He must be invisible !"". Feel free
    to use this image. After e-mailing Victoria taxi and being told by the Manager, Sean Convy ,  that they had 15 drivers who would not
  take guide dogs I decided to file a human rights claim.  Knowing the
  BC. Guide Animal Act was in place to protect us, I thought it would be
  a simple matter.  Although I had been refused in the past I felt for
  once the driver, Bruce MacGregor , should not
  blatantly disobey the law without consequences. The public hearing
  took place on 14th July, 2015.  Much to my distress and puzzlement
  Tribunal Member Jacqueline Beltgens ruled against me and dismissed the
  case.  Despite the tribunal conceding I was discriminated against and
  there being no evidence of an allergy together with the driver not
  even attending, Ms Beltgens made several conspicuous errors to rule
  against me.  Her written decision muddled facts with assumptions  and
  did not reflect the actual evidence, or lack of evidence,  presented
  at the proceedings. Myself along with all guide dog users hope to right this wrong done
  to us . Your contributions in this appeal will help towards reaching our goal
  of $15,000 required to fight this injustice. Blind people and their loyal companions across Canada will be forever
  grateful - Thank you. For other blind people around the world, please tell your stories on Google+ : Graeme McCreath P.S I fight this injustice with no malice. The reason
  it is so important is that Blind people and our guide dogs must make
  every effort to restore our access rights before further damage is
  done. This unfortunate ruling indicates the people making decisions
  affecting disadvantaged minorities are presently unable to grasp that
  an unequal taxi service is an illegal policy.  If a percentage of
  drivers do not take guide dogs (dogs which always lie quietly on the
  floor), then the availability and opportunity to get a taxi in any
  given situation is severely reduced for the very people who cannot
  drive and are in need of the community's help. I hope you will
  understand this and contribute right now to our campaign here at BLACKPRESS4GOOD.com Thank you BLACK PRESS for sponsoring such a system. PPS Letter from Frederick Driver to Times Colonist Blind taxi user was doubly victimized - Re: ""Tribunal
    dismisses blind man's complaint against taxi,"" Oct. 27,
  2015 B.C. Human Rights Tribunal member Jacqueline Beltgens has erred in ruling against
  guide-dog user Graeme McCreath . McCreath was not
  seeking a special ""accommodation,"" but rather the protection
  of his lawful rights. The Guide Animal Act clearly states that
  ""a person with a disability accompanied by a guide animal may, in
  the same manner as a person not accompanied by an animal, enter and
  use an accommodation, conveyance, eating place, lodging place or any
  other place to which the public is invited or has access so long as
  the guide animal is prevented from occupying a seat... and held by a
  leash or harness ... A person must not interfere with the exercise of
  [this] right."" It is the taxi driver who is seeking a
  special accommodation, not the guide-dog user. If such an
  accommodation is warranted, it is up to the taxi company to do the
  accommodating - not McCreath. It is outrageous that the company
  thinks denying McCreath his access rights under the law is an
  acceptable way to accommodate its employee. It must find another way -
  one that does not break the law. (Perhaps the installation of a
  Plexiglas barrier between front and back, which would also be
  beneficial for drivers' security and ventilation. Perhaps a desk job.) McCreath's rights are crystal clear and have been violated. He has
  now been doubly victimized, once by Victoria Taxi ,
  and once by the Human Rights Tribunal. Frederick Driver PPPS Note from Doris Belusic Re: Taxis can snub service animals, Oct. 20 Jacqueline
  Beltgens of B.C. Human Rights Tribunal says Graeme McCreath
  was only “inconvenienced,” when a Victoria Taxi driver denied him service and called a second cab to pick him up. Was
  Rosa Parks only “inconvenienced” by being shunted to the back of the
  bus, even though it would arrive at her destination the same time as
  the front? McCreath was discriminated against, plain and simple. At the hearing McCreath supplied proof of certification of his
  guide dog and of his blindness. In contrast, the taxi company lacked
  any specific dog allergy proof, even stating that some drivers just
  don’t want to take dogs. Yet the tribunal found the taxi driver’s
  evidence sufficient to dismiss McCreath’s case. Beltgens defied reason
  and endorsed discriminatory practices of Victoria Taxi, setting blind
  people’s equal access rights back decades. Beltgens and the Human
  Rights Tribunal didn’t “get” what discrimination is. DORIS BELUSIC Victoria http://www.vancouversun.com/touch/opinion/letters/canada+immigration+policies+need+discussed/11481592/story.html?rel = PPPS to get involved and for further informaton on

"My name is Paige (Erika to
  those who knew me young) and this is the story of How Eternity Conquers the world and lets me come too... . The Basics SUPPORT: What You can Do for Us Eternity is not able to attend school, needs full time supportive
  care and must maintain a 2000 calorie diet by drinking a special
  formula. If she is unable to maintain this regimen she will need a
  feeding tube re-inserted. The funds being raised in this campaign will
  go toward the cost of formula, medications not covered by insurance,
  travel expenses for multiple weekly appointments, bills that are
  piling up and other misc expenses that develop along the way. SHARE: What You can do for #SMASyndrome SMA Syndrome is extremely rare and has a 1 in 3 mortality rate. As I
  get more informed on this condition, It occurs to me that such a high
  mortality rate may be directly related to how little is known about
  SMA. Whether you donate or not, Please pass this story forward. Maybe,
  just by spreading the word, we can save a life. Eternity's Diagnosis story is not typical Most SMA cases go through a slew of misdiagnosis before being
  identified correctly. This was the case with Eternity too. Doctors
  were convinced she was dealing with Anorexia Nervosa and kept pushing
  Psych, but we knew this was not the case. How do you convice a doctor
  that you are not in denial? We used bargaining. Eternity finally
  agreed to see Psych IF they would order an Upper GI functionality
  test. She didn't know what it was called, but she figured if there is
  a Hydaa scan to watch your gallbladder flow, there must be something
  similar to that for your GI tract. Her challenge was accepted. Psych
  ordered a little something to help with her anxiety, but ruled out
  eating disorders all together and radiology confirmed Eternity's
  suspicion that the issue was functional. Eternity specifically asked for the test that diagnosed her, or we
  would be still be doing the specialist Do-si-do. Her
  Healthcare team said it time and again, ""The fact that you
    have taken such a forward participation in your care may have saved
    your life, ET"". A few things made this posible for
  Eternity, 1. her personality is such that she wants to know all things
  being discussed about her and doesn't let a doctor out of the room
  until she understands, completely, what they are syaing. 2. She was
  raised in a home where medical terminology & conditions are
  regularly discussed and used & 3. Eternity doesnt accept ""I
  don't Know"" for very long. ;) Why Shareing is so Important But what if you don't have a family imbedded in the medical field?
  What if you have not had 4 years of healthcare training by the time
  your 15? What if your personality is not as strong willed as hers?
  Eternity's condition was dire by the time we found it, but most are
  down to 90, 80 even 70 pounds with organ damage and other side effects
  of starvation by the time they are diagnosed. You can help by simply
  talking about it. Share this page or just tell a perrson and ask them
  to tell another. The Details Her Journey Our journey started about two years ago when Eternity
  started haveing so many different symptoms. Her pediatrician called
  Et her ""favorite little conundrum"" and sent her to
  specialists that are just as wonderful and awesome as Dr Sanguinetti
  is. Each one did very thorough testing and consulting and other Dr
  specialist kinda stuff. In some cases we found nothing serious, a tiny
  something that could have become bigger later, or even nothing at all.
  In Every case, we made a friend... or 6. Eternity spends 70 to 80 percent of her daily life at a
    physician's office , so she has become extremely comfortable
  in the environment. Her endocrinologist sat on the bed next
  to her and graphed three pages on how hormones work. The two of them
  laughed and learned together while the resident and I watched. Her genetisist verified her pending diagnoses for Ehlers-Danlos
  while she lay writhing on the exam table in pain, comforted her and
  called her surgeon who said to have her cross the drive way to the
  main hospital, he would see her in a few. That genetisist cares for all three of my youngest and frequently asks on them. Her surgeon diagnosed her gallbladder issue in under five minutes
  of meeting her, but stuck around to discuss medical terminology and
  then, after surgery, he stopped by twice to show her her images and
  discuss surgical technique and indication. These are just a few examples of how blessed we have been in
  Eternity's medical treatment. If we had to go through this, these are
  the people we would have hand picked to do it with. The Diagnosis SMA Syndrome ( Superior mesenteric artery syndrome ) is a rare, potentially life-threatening gastro-vascular disorder characterized by a compression of the third and final portion of the duodenum by the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery . Eternity has several unique diagnosis to her name, some even a bit silly sounding, but she has never had to grasp the
  idea of a longterm fight. She is solution oriented and a little type
  A, so a shot three times a year that balances things that are not, or
  a surgery that removes the part that doesn't work or even Yoga instead
  of hitting theweights to avoid dislocations - these are instant result
  solutions that require some healing and then life goes on. This fits
  quite neatly into her extremely goal oriented life style. SMA
    Syndrome does not. We have spent two weeks in the hospital and her
  biggest issue with the entire thing is ""Why can't they just fix
  it so I can go home?"" followed by the ever favored, ""Mom, I
  can do this myself. Just take out the tube and lets go home."" I'm
  constantly reminded of the tiny diapered little girl yelling at the
  top of her lungs, ""NO Mommy! I Do It MySthelf!"" Always so
  proud of her independance, this one. When this happens, I turn to research and videos to give her some
  appreciation for exactly how blessed we are to have found this issue
  before it caused more damage. They are a reality check of the
  strongest point and I'd like to share them with you too. What You Can Do As we look forward to the future, awareness sets in
  and we begin to plan. When Eternity leaves here, she will be on
  formula feeds until she can tolerate regular foods. By tolerate we
  mean that she will need to be able to eat with out pain and then keep
  the foods down long enough to be digested. Keeping up the caloric
  intake is hard physically. The feedings make her full and she feels
  ""yucky"". Often there is hope for several hours before she
  vomits everything she thought she had accomplished. Her physical strength is affected by the malnutrition and, as a child
  who LOVES to eat, she is very frustrated and hungry all the time with
  out the formula. Sleep is eratic because, almost daily, between 1am
  & 3am, she is awakened to vomiting anything left over from the
  previous day's efforts. This formula is expensive and NOT with in our monthly
  budget. In truth, neither is the gas, parking, food or travel
  costs for her appoinments. I am her full time care taker and do not
  work outside the home. Though she continues to want to attend school
  as much as possible, she is unable to do so any longer. We are asking for donations to assist with these costs and to take
  some burden off the monthly bills that are getting further and further behind. This quote from Eternity about 6 months ago sits in a treasure box of
  memories I keep close to my heart. I will forever strive to be this
  strong. I am so incredibly grateful for every single one of you that
  helps me help this child be ready for her patient.

"how ya doin my name is Greg Mullison , id like to tell you im doing
  great , but thats just not going to happen , between hospitals and
  insurance ive pretty much been drug thru the mud . About 6 or 7 months
  ago i went to the hospital with what i was told was a tear in my
  esophagus which they said they cauderized and i was good to go . well
  ever since that day i had trouble eating , could not get solid foods
  down , they would get stuck and eventually come back up. So i went
  back and they told me i had an esophagusal stricture and i needed to
  have my esophagus diaolated , but they had to wait for a referal from
  my insurance and i'd have to wait , well i waited and waited in the
  mean time i was losing wheight like nobodys business so i finally get
  the referal and i call and make an appointment to have my esophagus
  stretched and they gave me an appointment 2 and a half months down the
  road , i had lost 80lbs now and i told them i wouldnt last that long
  that i was literally starving to death they said take it or leave it ,
  so i took it and went straight to hoag hospital emergency and told
  them what happen . well they had me drink a little cup of water and i
  kept it down, then they had me eat 4 crackers and i threw them up
  right away the doctor came back and told me that they were discharging
  me to wait for my referal i siad but i cant eat she told me ""but
  you can keep water down and discharged me. Needless to say I was
  pissed off and went to another hospital down south  Scripps went to
  emergenc they addmitted me , they sent camera down my throat to
  dialate my esophagus and they saw blood and stopped , they told me
  that they could not dialate my esophagus with out a surgical team on
  stand by because they were afraid that they would tear my esophagus so
  i was there for 3 more days waiting snd they came back and said they
  didnt have a a good enough surgical team there and told me i had to go
  to a bigger hospital and discharged me so now ive gone literaly 6
  months with out any solid food , i had loost my job because nobody
  wanted me on there job site because i looked like death , so i went to
  another hospital Palomar again down south went to emergency and told
  them what happened and they are the ones that ask if any body had
  checked for cancer , now i would assume with as many camera's they had
  sent down my neck and as many exray's they had taken and they weight i
  had lost that would be the first thing they would check for ,and as it
  turns out they did and just sent me on my way without telling me , but
  anyways Palomar did the same thing the other hospitals did but they
  came up with a mass in my esophagus and now it has spread to my
  liphnoads so they sent me to an oncoligist whos all ready to do the
  chemo and radiation but my insuransce is dragging there feet so ive
  been waiting almost 2 more months waiting to get rid of this crap. out
  of money losing everything , disability is taking forever, i need help
  . palomar did put a tube in my stomach so i can feed myself . So thats
  where im at waiting for chemo with a tube sticking out of my stomach ,

"Easton Friedel was born 8/23/2012 with a rare genetic skin disorder,
  Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). This disease is incredibly painful and in
  Easton's case has come along with many other complications as well.
  The family has been traveling back and forth to the hospital multiple
  times a day, while trying to also care for their other three young
  children at home. Easton has been in the hospital for several months
  since he has been born, fighting for his life. The family has been
  unable to work due to the circumstances. This makes it very difficult
  on a family of six, to be able to travel, eat meals while at the
  hospital and just everyday life. As most of you know there has been a fundraising campaign in the
  past. All funds which are in a trust set up only for Easton's medical
  expenses not everyday costs, household bills, etc. We need your help.
  No donation is too small. We all appreciate your continued support and
  helping to spread awareness of this devastating disease. Update: Easton has come a long way since he was born almost five years ago.
  There have been ups and downs and he continues to face struggles
  health wise. He requires frequent visit to the EB Clinic in
  Cincinnati, OH as well as to see other specialists that have provided
  his care since birth. We are thankful for the improvements we have
  seen but know we still have an uphill battle. He is our strength each
  day and always with a smile on his face. Upcoming is the 18th Annual
  Debra Benefit which is held in NYC. This benefit attracts many that
  provide donations for not only awareness but a possible cure. In the
  Summer of 2018 there will be a Patient Care Conference held in
  Arizona. This event brings many families that are going/have gone or
  continue to go through what we experience. We were able to attend this
  two years ago with Easton as well as his brothers and it was a
  learning experience to say the least. There are many health care
  professionals as well as wound care providers that attend. There is a
  wealth of information and knowledge that is offered to not only the
  caregivers but to the siblings of the affected child as well. Easton
  was introduced for the first time to another child with EB. The look
  on his face and how he reacted, I will never forget. He will remember
  that day. To know there is someone else just like you when you see so
  many that make you look and feel ""different"". We continue to
  look forward to his future and are ready to face head on whatever
  comes our way.","33,760",,https://fundrazr.com/EastonFriedel,Support Baby Easton Friedel,,,

  other option because i am out of work for two years. Let me
  briefly explain the situation, to help you understand my plight and
  intention. Eight years ago I suffered specific injury in a car
  accident which, in my view, leaded to a new consequence because of
  wrong posture to relieve the painful side of the body. After so
  many years the result is very painful, Lumbalgia dex and
  Osteochondrosis of L5-S1 with posterior central protrusion (lumbar
  vertebrae) that causes narrowing of the spinal canal. To maintain mobility I am working out every day at home, have to
  sleep with pillows under my knees but pain persists and it is
  sometimes unbearable. To relieve the pain I have two options, one
  is to alleviate pain with painkillers and the other is pain relieve
  therapy which helps, but the personal doctor and physiotherapist are
  limited with prescribing therapies. So they deployed me to other
  specialists, among them also a surgeon is suggested. So my next
  step is to purchase the medical device and equipment; TENS to
  relieve pain by electrical stimulation of nerves and muscles
  (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), verified, it eases the
  pain, medical bolster with a diameter of 25 cm for relining knees
  while sleep and exercise (currently use pillows), rehabilitation mat
  with good grasp of the floor for exercises and warming IR
  light (pictures attached). I am aware that i should also consider a manual medicine, but first I
  have to take care of everyday mobility and ability to work, so i will
  be able to afford chiropractic or mo-gy therapy. And because
  these four things I absolutely need but can not buy, I turn to you
  with this campaign on fundrazr.com. I will be glad of your help
  and assistance, for forwarding my campaign to those who understand and
  are able to help. From the heart I thank you for your time and good will, that you read
  my call and you want to help. I wish you all the best in life.",300,of €300 goal,https://fundrazr.com/616QK1,Need your help to get a medical equipment,9,,Euro

"Hello Friends, By now you have heard the unfortunate news regarding the health of
  Alison James.  On September 10th,  Alison was diagnosed with a very
  serious and aggressive form of cancer, Cholangiocarcinoma - cancer of
  the bile duct.  This was shocking news to the James family, as Alison
  was feeling very well and would never have suspected that something
  this terrible was going on inside her. Since the diagnosis, Alison has gone through an extensive array of
  tests to determine what treatment options are available.  The best
  option is offered in Toronto, Ontario, where Alison, Brad and their 5
  month old son Rylan will live for the next 6-12 months.  Alison will
  undergo chemo, radiation, and finally a liver transplant. Due to the serious nature of this type of cancer and the time needed
  for treatment, the James family has had to put their lives on hold.
  While Alison focuses on her treatment, Brad has taken a year-long
  leave of absence from work to support her and care for Rylan.  This is
  not how they envisioned spending the fall with Rylan during his first
  year of life, but this is the hand they have been dealt.  They will
  leave behind their home, friends and family in Calgary. Due to the
  intensive nature of Alison’s cancer treatment, they will be renting a
  condo in Toronto.  Their cost of living has nearly tripled, while
  their income has been drastically cut. Many of you have offered to help.   We are asking you to consider
  giving whatever money you can to support Alison and Brad during this
  very difficult time.  These funds will go directly toward the cost of
  rent, travel, living expenses, and the many other expenses not covered
  by our healthcare system.  With the generous financial support of
  family and friends, Alison can focus on healing and not worry about
  how to cover the cost of her treatment and care.  While your financial
  support would be greatly appreciated, please don’t feel obligated to
  contribute if this is beyond your means. On behalf of Alison, Brad and Rylan, we would like to thank you in
  advance for your love and support.","39,745",of $50k goal,https://fundrazr.com/6bka7,Help Alison Fight Cancer,254,,Canadian Dollar
"Welcome to Poppy's Whisper... I would like to share Poppy-May's beautiful story on behalf of her
  loving parents. The phone rang. It was Jenny, Sinead's mum. Sinead had been involved
  in a car accident and had been rushed to hospital. As we flocked to
  her bedside, the nurse burst in to the room and whilst still strapped
  to the spinal board, Sinead received the news that she was pregnant, I watched Sinead blossom from my drinking buddy in to the perfect mother-to-be... Due to the accident Sinead received constant monitoring throughout
  the pregnancy. Just after her 20 week scan we were informed that the
  baby had a rare heart condition and the journey ahead would be a long road. The term, ""The Baby"", was beautifully replaced by Poppy-May
  Grace Thacker after Michael and Sinead returned from holiday. Poppy-May's chances of survival were slim but Sinead sacrificed
  everything she possibly could to give Poppy the best chance. The days
  were long and times were tough but the battle continued... Poppy was a fighter. She had beaten all of the odds and surprised
  every doctor who was lucky enough to meet her. Poppy-May fought with
  all of her might until she was 37 weeks. It was on Boxing Day when Poppy finally drifted off to to sleep... Poppy-May was delivered naturally on the 29th December, 2015
    at 1:37pm, weighing 4lbs 14ozs. Sinead and Michael had the best support, love and care in the arms of
  experienced midwives.The ""Serenity Room"" became their home
  for four days. It was a peaceful, calm and beautiful space BUT it was
  a little unhomely. There were some critical things missing in the room
  to make it feel like home. On behalf of Poppy-May, Sinead and Michael want to raise money to
  make these adjustments, not just in their local hospital but others alike. Please donate as much or as little as you can to start their journey
  on completing this important goal of theirs, in the name of Poppy-May.",765,of £5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/715pUf,Poppy's Whisper,31,,Pound Sterling

"Mark is literally one of those people who would give you the shirt
  off his back. As a former volunteer Langford firefighter, Mark and his
  wife Dana, are very well known to many in the community. This
  familiarity has also been due to their commitment to volunteer work,
  physical participation in local events, (in addition to monetary
  contributions) and their constant willingness to lend their helping hands. If you already know Mark, you know that he has already been
  living with Kidney Disease, and now Renal Failure for over 2.5 (almost
  3) years. This has been especially difficult for Mark, Dana and their
  family to manage, particularly because Mark has had additional health
  problems arise on top of his low kidney function, requiring many
  surprise, but necessary surgeries/hospital stays and dialysis changes. My proposal for Mark, Dana and their family is to raise enough money
  to help them afford Mark's potential stay in Vancouver, where his
  kidney transplant and aftercare would take place. Generally, the medically related costs for the kidney transplant
  itself are covered by the BC provincial health plan, but non-medical
  costs, such as travel expenses, accommodation, and meals etc., are
  not. Given Mark would be in Vancouver for 3 months, these costs can
  really add up! In this case, up to an estimated $8,000.00. Your generous donation to our fundraising campaign can help us reach
  our goal of $8,000.00 for Mark and his family during his stay. Any funds that are not used directly, or are ""left over""
  for Mark's stay in Vancouver & for his care, will be donated to
  the local Victoria Branch of the Kidney Foundation of Canada, to help
  others who may be in need. ~IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Due to the fact that this fundraiser is
      for an individual and is not affiliated with a registered charity,
      not-for-profit company or association, we regret we are NOT able
      to provide an offical tax receipt for income tax purposes.~ Many thanks for all of your contributions! The Cunningham Family is

  Therapy in Panama! The hope is that the stem cells will help in

"Hi My name is Blaine Maryniuk. Shelly Broesky is my
  wife Carol's and my sister in law. She is married to Carol's brother
  Robert and lives in Kelowna, British Columbia. To some of you who know Shelly Broesky you may be
  surprised to learn that she had a terrible fall from a 14 foot height
  which resulted in a fractured skull and not yet fully understood brain
  injuries.  This happened doing what she does best - decorating and
  making someone else's home look stunningly beautiful.  Unfortunately,
  she fell off a scaffolding while hanging Christmas lights on an
  outdoor tree. Since the accident, she has been bedridden with dizziness, extreme
  sensitivity to light and noise. She requires full time care.  Robert
  has taken on that role and consequently he cannot take on any work.
   The doctors don't know the full extent of her injuries but have
  advised that a full recovery could take six months to two years. We
  are all hoping and praying for a quick recovery, but frankly, we don't
  know how long this will go on. We do know that because neither of them
  can work, it is has already taken its toll on them financially and
  will continue to do so.  We don't want them to become buried in debt
  as this continues. Unfortunately, there is no insurance coverage for Shelly's accident
  and as a result, they are entirely on their own for their medical and
  living expenses.  Because there is not yet an end in sight, we felt it
  important that we be proactive in raising money for their living and
  medical expenses (medication, rehabilitation, etc). To those of you who know Shelly personally, you will know her as one
  of the most unselfish, kind, caring and giving people anywhere.  She
  always gives freely of her time and talents to so many people that
  ""giving"" could be her first name.  Compassion could be her
  middle name, so we decided to begin this fundraising campaign so that
  we could give back to her. We have set up this fundraising method to reach the widest number of
  people quickly.  Please share this with anyone you know and in
  particular, anyone that knows Shelly.  The donations made through this
  web site will go directly to them.  Someone has to administer the site
  and my commitment is to keep all information very private. It's Christmas time and I know that some of you are wondering how you
  are going to pay for all the gifts you have to buy.  May I ask that
  you think of giving a gift to Shelly and Robert that is made in the
  true spirit of Christmas.  Please give generously.  No gift is too
  small and no gift is too large. We don't have a firm goal because we really don't know how long this
  will take...but if we could raise $3,000 a month to cover 6 months
  time that would amazing.  If some of you want to give money directly,
  then I ask that you contact me and I can tell you how to do that. When we asked Robert if it was okay if we fundraised for them he
  answered, ""It is an answer to prayer."" If you would like to donate now, it would be greatly appreciated.","4,620",of $18k goal,https://fundrazr.com/e153Ab,Please help Shelly's recovery from a brain injury,22,,Canadian Dollar

  Spastic Quadripegic Cerebral Palsy. He is globaly delayed and
  non-verbal but that does't slow him down much! He currently gets
  around by the use of his manual wheelchair, a walker or by crawling
  and cruising along furniture. Because he spends so much of his time
  not weight bearing on his legs, he has been dealing with partial
  subluxation of his hips. One of the pieces of equipment we are trying
  to fundraise for is the Kid Walk Gait Trainer.  The biggest difference
  between the walker he currently has and the Kid Walk is the fact that
  he doesn't need to use his hands to hold on to it! That way he is free
  to use his hands while cruising around while supporting his trunk.
  Unfortunately it is not covered under any government funding programs
  and our insurance doesn't cover the cost of his equipment and this
  piece of equipment has a hefty price tag of roughly $5000 Canadian. He
  has used one through his school LOVES it! It gives him the ability to
  jump when he's in it as well which makes it so much more fun for him!
  More fun = more time spent in it = more weight bearing on his legs to
  combat the partial subluxation of his hips! We also need to upgrade
  his carseat situation. Ryker still requires the support of a carseat
  but is rapidly out growing the standard infant/toddler ones. The quote
  I got was just over $1000 for a Britax Snug Seat Traveller Plus.

  legs he is unable to obtain a full range of motion in his legs. They
  are always bent. We are currently looking into a surgical procedure
  that is only available in the States at the moment, so far it is
  looking unlikely that our Alberta Health Services will cover the cost
  and we will need to come up with the funds on our own. It's call SPML,

  story regarding this young lady and her family. For many years we've had people trying to get me to
  institutionalize KHYRA, as they felt that what our family was going
  through was unrealistic.  The truth is, she would have no where to go.
   Because she is unique, and has always been a ""grey area""
  ===we have to fight for every bit of support we get. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HT80cj0gCE For us though,  she fits perfectly in our family.  We LAUGH together,
  we LIVE and we LOVE, and we snuggle when we struggle, WE ALWAYS stick
  together because that what FAMILY does.    It is very
  exhausting to be a caregiver 24/7.  Our health supports for children
  with complexe medical needs are lacking in meeting a quality of life for families.  For 11 years we did
  this without asking for community support.  Khyra's father left two
  years ago, and I've had to do what was a challenge for two people...I
  have a wonderful partner who has stepped in and does what he can, and
  for that I'm grateful.However his health has not been top notch. The
  health of my family members has taken a hit, and when you are a
  caregiver, you do what comes naturally- your caregive. I'm
  tired, I'm trying to correct financial stress in our personal
  life as we have been trying to sustain a two income lifestyle with
    one income. The funds I'm raising is to support Khyras
    medical care needs, thus providing me some time for self care, to
    work in the summer , to attend my own medical appointments, and to
    allow for some extra care while I try to list my home and build an
    addition on a small 600 ft cottage that would reduce my monthly
  expenses. It has recently come to my attention that the
  market has placed our home value way  below what we owe on the
  mortgage . I feel like I have a solution, and then it falls to
  pieces.  Any funds we collect will help us to make this work for
  Khyra.  It's quite a challenge to move with a child with complex
  medical needs, let alone to keep up with all her needs on one income.
   I've never saught out help until the past year. WE need help
  please:) I am a woman of pride, but I feel I need my
  community right now.  I will pay it forward down the road, for now I'm
  humbly asking for your help. HOW TO HELP? It can be in forms of donations to help cover health care needs for
  Khyra, if you have a job opening -salary FT with health benefits, my
  partner is looking and ready to commit- carpenter, if you want to
  volunteer to help with the addition to small cottage for Khyra, or

"In July 2015, three-time breast cancer SURVIVOR Jamie Denson required
  a gruesome 9 hr surgery to remove a giant tumor both on &
  intertwined in her spine, entangled in the nerve root, strangling the
  spinal cord (a hair away from killing her), and a fractured spine. There was an 80% risk of dying from cardiac arrest or syroke on the
  operating table. She was cut in half on one side, had a collapsed lung
  & was on a ventilator, was paralyzed in both legs, & her body
  was in distress for 5 days. But she rehabilitated her legs and re-strengthened her core muscles
  where she was cut in half, walks now without a walker or cane, and she
  did not lose an organ which was a 50% to 80% risk. Thankfully, her
  lung recovered right after the surgery. However, it was the most terrifying, most excruciating, debilitating,
  dark thing she has ever gone through. Jamie is strong, resilient, intelligent, creative, and spiritual. She
  had overcome SO MUCH already, and right when everything was set and
  ready to go one way, just like that (fingers snap!), the rug was
  pulled out from under her, and her life was turned upside down. There were complictions from the surgery and issues she is still
  working to resolve. She has had to create her NEW ""normal""
  out of nothing. She continues to learn the needs, limitations,
  abilities, strengths, and possibilities of her ""new"" yet
  VERY scarred body that is no longer full-functioning; is filled with
  horrible, 24/7, debilitating pain that temendously limits her
  abilities to stand, walk, bend, lift, of move in certain ways which
  forced her to officially re-retire the Neuro-Muscular Therapy and
  Structural Re-alignment Bodywork side of her private practice Life
  Solutions (www.JamieDenson.com) which was a large portion of her
  regular business because she is a highly-skilled Master Bodyworker and
  Master Healer. The debilitating pain and recovery requires Jamie to take many hours
  a day OFF her feet with her legs UP to the mid-line level (but NOT
  elevated or bent too high), in a rested position, in soft chairs of a
  particular shape & support system--like her soft, leather recilner
  in the living room (which has become her bed). Additionally, Jamie has neuropathy WITH PAIN over 3/4 of her body, on
  both sides of her body. This condition forced her into making changes to her business much
  earlier than was planned and caused it to be a MUST rather than an option. However, she has taken on the challenge with an attitude of
  excitement and creativity, knowing--that, in the long run, it is for
  the best. Plus, there are at least 2 more surgeries (one to remove a mass in
  her face), other medical needs, and additional treatment plans that
  are NOT covered by insurance and involve travel expenses in addition
  to the treatment costs. Jamie's Neurosurgeon said the recovery & rehabilitation process
  is still 1 1/2 to 2 yrs more, but that her spine looks great and he
  expects she will continue to move forward WELL, with positivity and
  expectations of a LONG LIFE AHEAD. Jamie is brave and has overcome a great deal already. More than 80%
  of people with the same cancer do NOT even survive what she has
  ALREADY conquered. The numbers are equally LOW for how many people
  could endure all the things she has been through which include but are
  not limited to: *SURVIVING cancer THREE TIMES which includes terminal secondary
  breast cancer to the bones in 2015; *Survive the levels of severity, high-risk factors, unbearable pain,
  overcoming paralysis, and more--connected to the emergency spinal
  surgery she had to have to SAVE HER LIFE. Cancer of the bone is the most painful of all cancer types, and the
  recovery and rehabilitation processes are so long because Jamie's body
  has to ACCEPT the prosthetic (which it appears to have done) and GROW
  a new spine around the prosthetics (screws, plates, and rods, etc)
  where an entire section of her spine had to be REMOVED and REBUILT
  because of the cancer. She has come a LONG WAY, BEAT THE ODDS many times over, and been
  through medically UNEXPLAINABLE situations besides this one. That said, this is a long, very difficult journey. Jamie needs
  financial assistance for living expenses (food, meds, supplements,
  bills, etc) and for the transformation & expansion of her business
  to align her life to the ""new normal"" this condition has
  thrusted her into. Additionally, Jamie's medical journeys have sparked special callings
  that have become more clear. It begins with but is not limited to: (A) SHARING HER STORY because it may inspire, empower, or motivate others. (A.1.) She believes others like her need to know THEY ARE NOT ALONE; (B) Jamie is very often the VOICE for many others who cannot or do
  not speak up or do not know where to begin. She sees an EDUCATIONAL
  opportunity where her Expert Wordsmithing, Psychology education,
  Master Healer, Intuitive, and Life Coaching skills can be used to
  educate both sides on EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION skills through webinars,
  seminars, blogs, books, CDs, DVDs, movies, and more. Examples include
  but are not limited to: (B.1.) What the person with the condition NEEDS TO HEAR to feel
  emotionally supported; (B.2.) WHAT the non-patient can SAY and HOW to say it to SHOW your
  loved one that he or she is EMOTIONALLY AVAILABLE (to the patient); and (B.3.) COMMUNICATION REPAIR tips, scripts, and processes to help
  mend, strengthen, or support patients' relationships (especially with
  the Self) to create and nurture healthy EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS. Jamie would like to carry out these GOALS and callings through blogs;
  publishing ebooks and printed books; create movies;
  inspirational/motivational speaking engagements; webinars, seminars, etc. Another major calling Jamie has is a HUGE DESIRE to create a
  *FOUNDATION* that would provide a tiered program of FREE SERVICES for: (A) FINANCIAL assistance to purchase: (A.1.) HOLISTIC (non-GMO food); (A.2.) Whole-food based nutritional supplements; and (A.3.) Holistic therapies or services; (B) INFORMATION (un-biased, scientific information as well as from
  personal experiences) to ASSIST people in making well-informed decisions; (C) SUPPORT GROUPS to provide EMOTIONAL SUPPORT and SAFETY which are
  KEY to most people's survival and for a high quality of life; and (D) EDUCATE and ADVOCATE on Patients' Rights. Every $1 counts. Please help Cancer Warrior Jamie reach her goal, and

"Ever hear the story of Job from the Bible? We've all had our
  misfortunes in life, but not many people have experienced them like
  Job did. He is an example of faithfulness as he loses everything
  important to him, yet remains faithful to God. The only person I know
  of today who’s had his fair share of struggles in life and still stays
  focused on following God is my good pal OJ Williams. OJ is suffering from Pompe disease , a rare
  multisystem genetic disorder. ( Read more about Pompe disease
  here.) The disease has reduced OJ’s ability to breath on his own
  without a ventilator, made it difficult for him to walk – and even
  feeding himself is a struggle. The disorder has caused prolonged
  trouble communicating, and he has been confined to his bed for a
  little over a year! Who can imagine being stuck in a bed for a year?
  Not me. For years, through visit after visit to many, many doctors and
  specialists, the disease went undiagnosed correctly – until a visit to
  The Ohio State University finally found the culprit. Contracting
  pneumonia, dying on the table not once, but twice and being revived,
  having a heart attack, and confined to a nursing facility – that's
  enough to knock anyone to their knees. It's time for OJ to catch a
  break. He is optomistic that he will recover, since medication has
  been found to cure this disease. He is currently waiting for test
  results to come back before starting treatment. Please pray for a
  complete healing. Your contribution will help encourage him to beat
  this horrible disease. The reason I'm asking for your help today is to assist in offsetting
  his medical costs, setting up a fund for OJ once he is able to get out
  of the nursing home, so he can pay for things he'll need (such as
  rent, furniture, utilities, food, etc.) Your generosity will go a long
  way! Where your heart is, there you will also find your treasure.
  Please pray about it and give whatever amount is placed on your heart.

These can provide clues about how my cancer functions. The aim of the test is to identify potential treatment options and it will help my doctors to understand how well my cancer may respond to different drugs.

"I, Alexa Tatiana, mother of the 8th y.o boy Kirill Aleksa. I want to
  tell you our painful story … The TROUBLE has come to our house … which
  has changed our life, and we are forced to ask the world to help my
  Son! After undergoing a coma for some unknown reason we can't cure him
  for 3 years now!!! On March 8, 2013 my son Alex Kirill, born on September 19, 2007. (Who
  before the illness was absolutely healthy and very well developing
  boy, spoke two languages and read when was 5) had his body temperature
  raised till 39. I, Alexa Tatiana, Kirill's mother have called the
  family doctor for the domiciliary care. After examining my child
  doctor diagnosticate an ordinary virus. Zinnat, Ingalipt spray and
  vitamins were prescribed to us as antibiotics. At that time the child
  had neither a cough, nor cold. He lost appetite, his temperature
  varied from 37 to 38,5 but new symptoms didn't appear. On March 11 I
  have called the doctor again. After general surveying she has told to
  continue to the same treatment. He has nothing terrible, it’s just a
  virus she said. In the late afternoon the child was very sluggish and
  refused to eat or drink. Approximately at 18:00 I have called the
  ambulance. The ambulance has brought us to infectious diseases
  hospital. On the way there my son talked to me. In the hospital my son
  was taken from me to put a catheter. I wasn’t allowed to be there.
  After a while they have brought me a sleeping child and told me that
  he had temperature of 38,5 and they forced it down . Approximately at
  the midnight he opened his eyes for a couple of minutes, but just
  stare at one point. I took him in my arms and ran to doctors, where I
  was told there is nothing terrible he likely has frozen. I was
  returned to chamber. In two hours the same has repeated again, then
  they have taken him in reanimation. Kirill’s breath vanished,
  convulsive attacks appeared. His health went from bad to worse. Several years later the clinical record of my child disappeared from
  that hospitals archives … Due to the deterioration on March 14, 2013
  we have transported him in the Center of Mother and Child in intensive
  reanimation. There Kirill was connected to the artificial respirating
  unit. He was in a coma of a third degree, with the presumable “viral
  encephalitis “ diagnosis which was later placed in doubt. The child
  still has no diagnosis … We have stayed in the hospital for 2,5
  months. When he was in a coma, the chances doctors gave us were 1 out
  of a 100%. Doctors assume, but the Lord has returned our boy to us and
  that means that he HAS THE RIGHT FOR LIFE!!!!!! When he was discharged
  from hospital he couldn’t even sit. Ever since he emerged from a coma
  Kirill doesn't talk, suffers from epileptic seizure which can’t be
  stopped medicamentally. Motility and motor system is partially
  restored. Our main problem is spasms, after which the child’s
  condition goes three steps back again. We consulted and we are still treated at the best doctors in Moldova,
  but unfortunately, they make a helpless gesture and can make nothing.
  Lately were constantly admitted in reanimation with the diagnosis
  ""Status condition of epilepsy"". We tried various health
  aids, ordered very expensive medication from Italy, Russia, Romania
  and Germany which we don't have here in Moldova. But all that failed
  to suit us. Since we can not stop the attacks, it gets worse. As our
  case is in itself rare, and our very own doctors very much recommend
  to us to go for diagnosis and treatment to the clinics which are more
  developed in this area. By own efforts we carried the child on
  inspection to Russia, Romania and Italy, but even there, we were
  advised to take the child to Germany as there is the strongest
  medicine in our area. We have sent our documents to the German clinic
  and they have agreed to undertake our case. The initial amount of
  diagnostics and primary treatment is 16500 euros. It is our CHANCE to
  return our child to normal life!!!! Therefore, we ask you with a big
  heart for help, someone, anyone who have been touched by our misfortune! I beg you as a mother, PLEASE HELP US!!!!! I cry to hear my child’s
  voice again, to hear the poem about MOTHER which my kid told me a day
  before the incident on a morning performance in the kindergarten!!!
  PLEASE HELP us to relieve our child from sufferings. We with gratitude will accept any of Your help which will help our Kirill. Sincerely, Alexa Tatiana",605,of €16.5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/317D9d,8 y.o Kirill really needs your help!!!,3,,Euro

"Hello, welcome to our Super E page, my name is Lindsey and I am
  Ethan's Auntie. I want to share Ethan's story so that, together, we
  can raise funds for Ethan's necessary medical equipment and ongoing
  medical/therapy expenses due to his undiagnosed Congenital Myopathy. I
  am heading this campaign to help Ethan’s Mommy and Daddy, Scott &
  May, to alleviate some of the financial stress affecting them so they
  can focus entirely on their amazing little boy. When our family began
  this journey with E, we had no idea the expenses they would face and
  they have never once asked for help. There have been many unexpected expenses associated with Ethan's
  complex medical issues. Due to the fact that Ethan needs 24/7 care, it
  has not been an option for his mommy to return to work, and this will
  be the case for the foreseeable future. His parents work hard to share
  his accomplishments and strengths but the reality is; every day is a
  battle to keep him healthy and out of the hospital. His parents and home care nurses work tirelessly to prevent acute
  life threatening events. Scott and May continue to exhaust every
  avenue they can find to fund Ethan's equipment, supplies and care but
  are realizing that the future will hold many expenses that they just
  can’t manage on their own. They are the two most amazing people and together with Super E they
  form a tight, loving, dedicated family unit. Since birth, Super E’s
  life has been filled with complex health issues that have challenged
  both him and his Mommy and Daddy. He has faced more struggles in his
  young life than many of us will in our lifetime and we are all so
  proud and amazed by him. His adorable little mouth might not yet be able to hold a full smile,
  but you can see it in his eyes as he truly lights up the room when you
  are in his presence! Please help us to help them. We are also offering
  perks as a thank you for your donation, take a look through them. They
  will be shipped to you at the end of the campaign, don't forget your
  address! (limited to Canada for shipping reasons) How E's story began Ethan's Mom had an uneventful and healthy pregnancy which culminated
  in a traumatic delivery. Their whole world turned upside down, when 7
  days after his birth, their sweet baby boy was admitted into the
  pediatric unit at Victoria General Hospital suffering from low weight
  gain, and general weakness. They went from proud new parents to
  anxiously watching over Ethan while medical staff poked and prodded,
  administering test after test, trying to find out why he was struggling. Within a few days Ethan was being tube fed, had been transferred to
  the PICU, and had suffered a lung collapse which resulted in him being
  attached to a ventilator. It was determined that Ethan needed to be
  transferred to Vancouver Children’s Hospital for more intensive care
  and testing. He was flown via air ambulance to the PICU and the
  testing continued. Scott and May spent the first 2 months of
  parenthood in Vancouver with Ethan in the PICU, on a journey filled
  with both heartbreak and rewarding love for all of them. A little about Super E Now... “Beep…Beep…Beep…” this is the sound that Ethan, or “Super E” as we
  have come to call our little soldier, hears every night while he
  sleeps, and probably will be hearing for the next few years of his
  life. Ethan’s oxygen levels must be monitored by a pulse oximeter
  which is attached to his toe while he sleeping. Every night Ethan is
  hooked up to 3 or more different pieces of equipment to support his
  health and to alert Ethan’s daddy and mommy, Scott and May, or his
  night nurse, of any life threatening incidents concerning his
  breathing and alarms for his continuous feeds. The hum of his BiPap
  machine has become the familiar sound that lulls the family to sleep
  every night. (above Ethan's BiPap and his nightly set up and below Ethan's
      showing his feeding tube) While other 1.5 year olds have met their crawling and walking
  milestone, Ethan is still working hard on sitting unassisted due to
  his low muscle tone and he still needs the support of a newborn when
  you pick him up,. Although Ethan is not meeting these standard
  milestones,he is defining his own milestones and mapping his own journey. Ethan has made great strides in a short time with his core strength
  and every day he is managing to sit for longer periods and holding his
  head up with less and less support. Speech is also a challenge, due to the low muscle tone, but Ethan is
  learning to communicate using sign language, as his hands develop more strength. All these accomplishments are a result of many hours of hard work
  from Ethan along with his therapists and caregivers who come to their
  home regularly and are further reinforced by Scott and May's
  dedication to practicing and encouraging Ethan over and over again. Why does he need funding? Because of his current physical limitations, he requires much
  supportive equipment, devices and therapies. Most of these items and
  services are only partially covered by government funding and cost
  many thousands of dollars. Many of his medical supplies need to be
  purchased directly out of pocket and there is no reimbursement
  available for these items. So that Ethan can continue to physically develop, he requires many
  pieces of specialized, supportive, modified gear such as specialized
  seating. Ethan also requires a stander to assist him standing upright
  and aid him in weight bearing on his legs. He is very fortunate to currently have a couple of these items at
  home on a trial basis, but, they are only loaner items from his
  therapy center, Queen Alexandra Centre for Children's Health. These
  loaners will need to be returned very soon so other local families can
  trial them and Ethan will need his own set to continue supporting his
  development. As you can imagine, the cost for these items is
    astronomical . The cost for the stander and adaptive seating
    system alone will be almost $10,000 and only
      about $3,200 of that will be covered. Adaptive equipment
    is shockingly expensive. And the list goes on for future needs: Stander, Adaptive Seating
  System, Early Activity System Mat, Power Wheelchair, Manual
  Wheelchair, Walker and Adaptation of vehicle to accommodate wheelchair. The list continues to grow as time goes on and his family was
    not prepared for these extra expenses. There are also
  therapy treatments offered only in the United States that may aid in
  his ability to swallow. These treatments will have to be paid for
  entirely by the family and will cost several thousands of dollars to
  cover travel and session costs. They quickly have become accustomed to all the equipment and many
  daily medical routines as their norm and just don't realize how many
  people that they have inspired and impacted on this amazing journey
  they are on. We hope you are one of the many who have been inspired by them
    and by Super E and we hope you are able to show your support to
    them. This is where your donations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read about our special baby panda. I
  cannot begin to express how much this little boy means to our family
  and friends. He has made a huge impact on our lives the moment he
  entered this world and has continued to do so on a daily basis. He
  truly is our hero! If you would like to know more about Ethan, check out his blog here: http://posthope.org/super-e/journal","12,795",of $10k goal,https://fundrazr.com/110Ija,Super E's Medical Fund,124,,Canadian Dollar
"Up until August 2015, Jessie Huggett, who has Down syndrome, was a
  vibrant and articulate young woman.  She was passionate about many
  things: dancing with Propeller Dance (Canada’s
  foremost mixed-ability dance company,) visual art, spending time with
  her family and boyfriend - and letting the world know that having Down
  Syndrome doesn't need to limit one’s life. A national advocate for the
  Canadian Down Syndrome Society (see one of the videos ), Jessie brought this message to
  television, radio , newspapers and live audiences. Late last summer, while vacationing with her family in Maine, Jessie
  suffered her first stroke.  She was diagnosed with Moyamoya, a rare
  neurovascular disorder, and told that without neurosurgery, she
  remained at high risk of further strokes.  Jessie's stroke impacted
  her ability to swallow and necessitated a liquid diet.  But Jessie
  fought back, regaining full form and preparing herself for surgery. While her parents, Nancy and Dan, researched surgery sites in Canada,
  Jessie's grandmother, Mary, put aside money for Jessie to get the best
  care possible. Sadly, Mary herself was dying, having been diagnosed
  with terminal melanoma just a few weeks after Jessie's stroke. Mary
  died in October and this was her last expression of love for her granddaughter. Now that it was doable, Boston Children’s Hospital offered the best
  choice possible. The surgeon and team had performed the operation,
  essentially a brain bypass, many times—a depth of experience that can
  not be found in Canada. In addition, the treatment would be performed
  in a single surgery; Canadian alternatives consisted of a two-stage
  process, doubling the risk of complications. Nancy and Dan were secure
  in the knowledge that the money left by Mary would cover the entire cost. Jessie's surgery, on January 27, went well; everyone breathed a sigh
  of relief.  That evening, however, Jessie suffered another stroke, far
  more debilitating than the first.  Her life was in danger and the
  planned-for one night stay in ICU turned into eight long days and
  nights. Doctors' consultations, tests, extended care ....it all added
  up.  Jessie was discharged on February 8. Nancy and Dan faced a
  serious shortfall on the hospital bill. The family is now back in Ottawa and happy to be home, but with many
  challenges ahead. Jessie faces a very long road to recovery, as
  the second stroke affected her speech, swallowing, and ability to
  initiate movement.  Although the spark is still in Jessie's eyes when
  she sees her favourite people, her progress is slow and she will
  require care 24/7 for some time to come. But Jessie is strong and we
  all hope that in time, she’ll return to form. The message Jessie has
  spent her life spreading, that nothing should keep anyone down, is
  especially personal now.","26,550",of $30k goal,https://fundrazr.com/516G69,Help Jessie Get Her Voice Back,235,,Canadian Dollar
"Martine was 6 months old when I first met her. She
  was born with no feet. With proper prostheses, made in Haiti, she
  leads a normal life, although in an orphanage. She and many others,
  casualties of the numerous causes of handicap (like genetic diseases,
  stroke, accidents, violence, mental illness) are my inspiration -
  along with their families, care givers and local and international
  medical professionals and volunteers, who are their hope and salvation. Before the end of the year I will be going back again
  to visit Martine, now 8, and to begin interviewing various actors and
  start writing, photographing and filming the documentary. You can
  follow me on this abilityhaiti blog . The budget for this initial trip is $4000.00 for
  travel and accommodations. Generous friends and family have already
  donated $1000.00. A number of other trips will follow. Life is hard in Haiti, even with progress since the
  earthquake of 2010. Yet, Haitians are the most wonderful, resilient
  and proud people. Living with a disability in a developing country is
  often a brutal struggle. Yet, those I've met are among the bravest,
  most loving people I've known. Project Mission To research, study and create a compelling, multi-platform
    documentary and ongoing dialogue respectfully illuminating the
    subject of disability and persons with disability in Haiti. To raise awareness and resources for work and school reintegration
    programs and a newborns with disabilities rescue project. To add to the knowledge of the subject in the developing world. What is the 'story' - it's complex and complicated
  and needs in-depth research to bring it into the light. It will be
  a comprehensive investigation into the human, historical, social,
  ethical, cultural, medical, economic and political aspects of
  disability in Haiti, with a special focus on the most vulnerable -
  abandoned orphans with disabilities. AbilityHaiti is the project name. abilityhaiti.org (TBA) is the web site. ""Cocobai* - Ability and Disability in
  Haiti"" is the title of the video documentary. *A derogatory Creole word for the handicapped, meaning 'worthless' or 'disgraced'. Objectives Develop a real time web site reporting on the progress of the
    documentary, while raising awareness of and funding for the project
    and future foundation. Ensure that the project is Haitian centric with the maximum
    participation from, partnerships with and benefits to Haitians,
    including those with disabilities, their care givers and families. Leverage the documentary to increase awareness of persons with
    disabilities to fundraise for a future Foundation for the Most
    Vulnerable in Haiti. The goal of the foundation will be to fund
    treatment, support and education. Leverage all the outcomes to raise awareness of similar phenomenon
    in other developing countries. Audiences: Geographical - North America, Caribbean Languages - English, French, Creole Demographic – young adults, adults, M/F Sub targets – Haitian diasporas/associations, governments,
    foundations, corporations, NGOs, media. Point of view / Introduction - why
  am I doing this project and what is it about? Persons with disabilities (those who live with one or more of a wide
  range of physical, sensory, intellectual or mental health impairments)
  are among the most vulnerable in humanity. Among the worse off of
  these are the children with disabilities. And the most vulnerable of
  all are the rejected, abandoned, abused, helpless, disenfranchised
  orphans with disabilities. Disabilities occur in a wide range of forms – physical, intellectual,
  emotional, psychological – and have many causes including trauma and
  injury, disease, genetics, poverty and deliberate harm. Persons with
  disabilities in Haiti exist at the bottom of the human strata piled
  high above them. They are at the very bottom of the world’s bottom
  billion(1), those subsisting on less than $2.50 U.S./day. Underneath
  them are the totally helpless abandoned infants and children with
  hydrocephalus, club foot, cerebral palsy, amputations, Down syndrome,
  deafness, blindness, malnutrition, congenital heart defects– the list
  is very long and certainly includes broken hearts and minds. And the list grows with age. Adults who continue to survive childhood
  disabilities or who have become afflicted, robbed of normalcy later in
  life – by strokes, spinal cord injuries, traumatic accidents,
  crippling diseases and many other disabling conditions - face
  mountainous challenges, from physical and economic deprivation to
  overt discrimination and insidiously silent biases and social rejection. Once you encounter Haitians with disabilities, some 800,000 (2)
  before the earthquake, and more than 1.1 million today (3), they
  become our neighbours , existing as they do in North
  America, right in our own backyard which, for most of us, is only a
  few hours from the homes, hospitals, schools, churches, shopping
  malls, health clubs and movie theatres that we have the privilege to enjoy. Once felt and understood, this epiphany is transformed into compassion without borders . It’s called empathy.
  Only then can there be dedicated thought and action to reach down to
  pull up the crushed from underneath us, along with the ignorance
  skulking in the depths of our own humanity. It is a hopeless act to document the pathos and pain of persons with
  disabilities in Haiti without fathoming context and causes, remedies
  and ongoing solutions. In fact, since the consciousness shaking
  earthquake of January 2010, the rate of improvement within the
  country, in social awareness, government legislation and medical
  infrastructure directed towards restoring and improving the lives of
  persons with disabilities, is measureable and has momentum. Globally, the specialized and comprehensive fields of physical
  medicine and rehabilitation therapy are as invigorated as any in
  medicine and offer healing tools and programs, technologies and
  promising research to bring hope and solutions to even the most
  geographically, politically and socially isolated and destitute places
  in the world, including Haiti. To muster the herculean efforts and
  resources required to make it better and bring equality of life to all
  children and adults with disabilities, whom this documentary will
  speak for, provides a forum for and bears witness to, remains one of
  the most important and seminal challenges of our times and a test of
  our civilization itself. To the extent that Haitians can lift up their wounded today, they
  will be able to lift up their country tomorrow and if the rest of our
  North American community can’t learn how to more effectively support
  our most vulnerable neighbours, humanity will bury its own soul along
  with its victims beneath the weight of a collapsed morality. Note: The United Nations estimates that 1 billion individuals
  world-wide live with one or more disabling conditions. One household
  in every four has a disabled member—which means that an estimated 2
  billion people live with disability on a daily basis.(4) I will be applying for charitable organization status with the CRA
  soon. Updates to follow. Thank you for your consideration and helping to tell the story of
  persons with disabilities in Haiti. Eric Doubt References 1. Collier, Paul; The Bottom Billion, Oxford

"My 27 year old daughter, ​Rose has been tube feeding since 2009. She
  is on a permanent disability and our provincial government covers the
  cost of her formula and supplies, but unfortunately all of the
  formulas available through the program commercial formulas and the
  main ingredients in all of them are GMO maltodextrin and GMO high
  fructose corn syrup! The rest of the ingredients are refined and/or synthetic. Rose used those formulas until about a year ago when through my
  research I found a whole food, organic formula called, Liquid Hope,
  made in the US by a company called functional formularies. ​Of course we wanted to get Rose going on this formula immediately,
  but tube feeding formulas are very expensive. The one she was using
  costs about $1000 a month, and is covered by the provincial
  government, whereas this amazing whole food formula is not. Liquid
  Hope costs approximately $1500 a month, including shipping.  That is
  why I launched our previous campaign to raise money to get her started
  on Liquid Hope as soon as we possibly could. Rose started on Liquid Hope in December 2014 and her health
  immediately began to improve.  Her blood test results improved, she
  slowly started to gain weight and she began to have normal bowel
  movements for the first time in years. We used up all the fundraised money quite a few months back now and
  have barely been able to keep buying Liquid Hope.  During this time I
  have been working on having Liquid Hope approved as a formula covered
  by Rose's disability and I have finally made a bit of progress, but it
  is very slow going. Below is a comparison of the formula the government will pay for that
  Rose was using and Liquid Hope. After looking at the difference in the
  ingredients of both, I think it will be pretty obvious why she NEEDS
  to switch permanently to Liquid Hope. Please help if you can! ​ ​ Liquid Hope ingredients: ​ ​Filtered water, organic garbanzo beans, organic green
  peas, organic carrots, organic whole grain brown rice, organic whole
  grain rice protein, organic flax oil, organic sprouted quinoa, organic
  sweet potato, organic broccoli, organic almond butter, organic kale,
  organic garlic, organic turmeric, organic rosemary, organic ginger,

"Logan Mac is a 5 year old boy who was diagnosed with cancer in 2012
  at 18 months old. He was treated at Vanderbilt Children's until March
  8, 2013 when he was found to be in remission! He was 3 years cancer
  free as of March 8, 2016. He is now down to scans every 6 months and
  an ultrasound and labs every 3 months. Last year we found out his
  ongoing pain is due to Hypermobility Joint Syndrome and
  Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome. BWS increases his risk of not only his
  original cancer coming back (Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma Stage 3) but
  also his chances of getting other cancers (Wilm's Tumor and liver
  cancer). Due to him being immobile during his fight with cancer, his
  muscles deteriorated which is why he is in pain. We spent 3 years
  trying to find out why Mac lived in constant pain. We tried
  traditional PT with little success. We then branched out and tried
  other treatments. The pool helped some but he isn't a fan of swimming.
  We then found a place near us that focused on equine therapy, or
  Hippotherapy. That is what the picture is of. Since starting it in the
  middle of last year, he was improved by leaps and bounds! He has just
  recently started riding the horses as we had to build to that. He has
  finally found something that he loves and does not see as 'therapy'!
  And that has made all of the difference! He feels free and he feels a
  sense of accomplishment. He has also found something he has been
  looking for: friends. In these horses, he has found friends. Friends
  who don't care that he has disabilities and friends who don't laugh at
  him. They listen when he talks and they give him an outlet to be open
  and honest. While it may seem silly to some, for him it means the
  world. He's smiling and laughing again! He's excited to get up and
  start the day because he knows therapy is coming up on Wednesdays! And
  in all honesty, it has done our hearts so much good to see our baby
  smiling and laughing again. His life has been doctor after doctor,
  test after test. Now he is living and thriving! We fundraised
  before and used it all to pay for this therapy. However, it is about
  to run out again and we just cannot afford it on our own. To sum it
  up, our van recently gave out forcing us to get a new one we are
  making payments on, our oldest son has many therapies for his Autism
  and behavioral issues, and our daughter is seeing specialists for her
  gluten intolerance and her eye issues. So it is just not something in
  our budget right now. We hate to even ask for help but we have
  exhausted all options and any help you can give would be most
  appreciated!! Even $1 helps us! Each session, which is an hour long,
  is $100. And he goes once a week for an hour. Please help if you can

Jade is a 15 year old young lady that was recently diagnosed with Leukemia.  Please donate to help her family with expenses.,"11,325",,https://fundrazr.com/4TlYa,Let's help Jade kick cancer's ass!,,,
"I am 37, mother of two beautiful girls, ages 12 and 9, and wife of 12
  years. I was first diagnosed with Stage3b Cervical Cancer in 2012 and
  have since run out of treatment options in my home state of NC and I
  don’t want to die. My insurance does not travel outside the state of
  NC so I need help in order to cover out of state Cancer Center ASAP,
  my cancer is aggressive and it's spreading.  donations will cover
  travel and hospital fees first, then other out of pocket treatment
  expenses and personal expenses. Here’s the story of my fight with cancer. I was first diagnosed with Stage3b Cervical Cancer in
  2012 . After a radical hysterectomy on December 28, 2012, an
  outside pathological study had revealed that “my cancer” had spread to
  my lymph nodes and to other areas outside of my cervix.  It was then
  decided that the cancer that originally was thought to have been in
  early stages and had not spread would require further treatment of
  brachytherapy (internal radiation), external beam radiation and
  adjuvant chemotherapy treatment of a drug called Cisplatin.  After
  months of treatment and recovery, my life slowly returned to as normal
  as it could until pain began to persist in my left pelvic region and
  in my back.  After a number of phone calls and pleadings with my
  oncologist to investigate, in 2014, she finally agreed to perform a
  scan, however, it was for the purposes of supporting her idea that the
  back pain was not cancer related and she would be sending me out to
  some sort of back specialist in order to address that pain and that
  the pain I was feeling in my pelvic area was a result of forming scar
  tissue and the healing process of nerves in that area after my surgery. Once the scan was performed, I received the devastating news that my
  intuition was right, and that the pain, in fact, was due to new cancer
  mass in my left lower abdominal wall and it would need to be removed
  ASAP. She also revealed that the cancer was most likely the
    result of what she called a port site recurrence -a
  phenomenon believed to occur through the transfer of cancer cells from
  surgical tools or to high of CO2 pressures during surgery robotic
  surgery and the cancer cells would “seed” in the scar tissue where I
  was cut open.  There was less than a 1.5% risk of this occurrence, a risk that was not known to me and was not even
  included in any of my paper work warning me of what could happen if I
  agreed to this surgery. The cancer was removed in November of
  2014 , at which time, my bowel was twisted before she closed
  the area that she opened up and caused a bowel blockage that
  hospitalized me for several weeks. In January of 2015, I began another regimen of external beam
    radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy for months and then
  once that was complete, I began what is called, systemic chemotherapy,
  with 2 different chemo therapies along with the addition of a new drug
  that had been approved as an addition to the normal “standard of care”
  or treatment that was intended to slow down the future recurrence of
  disease and hopefully increase survival periods. During my systemic
  chemo treatments, I began to have pain onset and progression similar
  to the previous recurrence/mass, to which my oncologist, again, said
  was an unlikelihood for several reasons, but said she could not
  perform a scan until the completion of chemotherapy for accuracy
  purposes to know for sure.  Once I completed chemo, a PET/CT was
  performed, at which time, yet another tumor was
  discovered .  My oncologist told me there was nothing
    she could do for me at this point but remove the tumor and
  wait for another recurrence and continue to remove them as we are able
  for as long as we could while holding out for data for other cervical
  cancer treatments.  When she said this, I cried, I ran out of the
  office and screamed when I went outside and immediately fell to my
    knees. I was DEVESTATED!!!!! My heart sank as soon
  as I realized that I would have to tell my sweet girls that this
  chapter of our lives is not yet behind us.  I also made the choice to
  no longer use that oncologist and contacted another, who was able to
  enroll me in a clinical trial that I have been a part of for the past
  three months, which leads me to where I am today…..The clinical trial
  I was in got suspended by the CDC and FDA with no notice of
  returning.  I am out of NC treatment options; my insurance doesn’t
  cover out of state expenses.  I called MD Anderson and they want a
  $29k dollar deposit, and Cancer Centers of America are asking for
  $250k.  All other treatments are going to cost money, plus travel.  I
  have reached the limits of my insurance and all local options for
  treatment.  I don’t want to die.  I don’t want my sweet girls to grow
  up without a mom, but that is what’s going to happen if I don’t get
  help for treatments and expenses.  Please do not allow me to become
  another cancer statistic, I beg you.  Thank you to everyone who helps
  support me in my fight.  I am not famous, I know, but I don’t deserve
  to die, and I certainly do not deserve to be a casualty due to
  financial loss or absence.  Our worth is measured by more than the
  checks we can write. My family has been devastated by all of this. I don’t want my girls
  to learn to give up or that our life’s value is determined by
  insurance and pharmaceutical companies, research labs and cancer
  centers, majorities or louder minorities.  1 person suffering from a
  disease is enough to warrant budgets, research, funding and so on. 
  All options left for me are immunotherapies, which can be
  revolutionary in helping to teach our bodies to fight this disease
  itself and others; This is no coincidence.  Helping me will also help
  other women in my position if science can learn from me.  It could
  save yours or my daughters’ lives some day.  God has blessed me with
  being a healthier patient in the respect that this disease has not
  traveled to my organs. I am confident that God’s will is for me to be
  here, to help, through my “trials”, save the lives of other women,
  with my fight. The estimated cost for Md Anderson, including travel and cancer
    hopsital deposit is  32,450 In order to net that amount, there must be a gross contribution of
  34,892 (fundrazr keeps around 7%) Lymphodema Treatment plus gas will cost 5563 and will need to have

"Brent and Fiona fell deeply truly in love shortly after meeting in
  2015. Little did they know that a few short months after meeting Brent
  would be receive a diagnosis that would change their lives. Within days after Brent proposing to Fiona, he was diagnosed with
  later stage esophageal cancer, and the odds were terrifyingly slim. With the prospect of Brent's life being drastically cut short, the
  devastated couple have decided push the date of their wedding up
  considerably. The diagnosis came in January, and they want to be
  married in April....and that date may even be too late. Weakened and sick from radiation treatment, and now, chemotherapy,
  Brent no longer works, and Fiona has taken time off to take Brent to
  appointments and care for him. With no car to get to appointments, the
  couple have to take public transit from their New Westminster
  apartment to Abbotsford, and then, take public transit with Brent
  sick, vomiting and weak, back home after radiation or chemotherapy
  appointments. Their already meagre income does not allow for any
  comforts, and indeed, many necessities. With Brent already being fed through a tube in his stomach because he
  can no longer swallow food due to the tumour blocking his esophagus,
  they are running out of time, and have already run out of money. Fiona and Brent would like to have a simple wedding, hopefully on the
  paddlewheeler in New Westminster where they had their first date.
  Fiona has cobbled together enough money to buy a second hand wedding
  dress that she needs to tailor to her already very slim frame. Help Fiona and Brent get married - help them triumph in their love,
  even if they are unable to triumph over this terrible disease. Monies raised will first go towards helping Brent and Fiona pay for
  necessities such as baby formula - as Brent can't eat solid food, he
  is fed through a tube in his stomach. Formula is expensive, but it is
  the only thing that can sustain him physically at the moment. It will
  pay for a taxi ride to take Brent home from appointments where he is
  too weak to travel on transit. Secondly, monies will be used towards helping Fiona and Brent pay for
  their wedding - even paying for someone to officiate at a wedding
  costs over $125, and is well beyond their means at the moment. Help these two join their lives, and their love. Help Brent live long
  enough to marry the love of his life. Please donate to this sweet and
  worthy couple to help them. I hope to be able to post pictures on here of their wedding, but I
  can only do this if you help. Thank you.",625,of $4k goal,https://fundrazr.com/b17B05,A fight for life and love: Help Brent & Fiona,2,,Canadian Dollar
"Our daughter Mia was suddenly diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at only two years old. Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a genetic, auto-immune disease in which the pancreas stops creating insulin to break down sugar, resulting in a life-long dependence on synthetic insulin. Mia was a trooper during her stay at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Sanai Hospital. She has done an amazing job adjusting to this new lifestyle. As you can imagine, this diagnosis has changed all of our lives. To stay alive, people with T1D must take multiple insulin injections daily or continually infuse insulin through a pump. Each day, we have to carefully monitor food and insulin intake for Mia. Constant maintenance is vital to avoid high or low blood sugar reactions that can be life-limiting or life threatening. The goal of this fundraiser is to offset the costs of expensive medication, hospital bills and medical supplies needed on a daily basis.",330,,https://fundrazr.com/4SCLb,Warriors For Mia: A Type 1 Diabetes Fundraiser,,,

  great first appointment with Bob's New Dentist, Dr. Nimz. In fact, he
  was so blown away by our family pitching in that he gave us a 10%
  discount! Bob should have dentures in 4 weeks! First step is a
  cleaning. If you noticed we raised the goal it is because we did not
  anticipate the cost of extractions. Bob will then have 5 teeth
  extracted. The good news is it will be the same day as the appointment
  and his new Dentures will be put in place to help him heal. Thank you
  again so much for all you gave. We are so excited for Uncle Bob! Mac Donald family here! Robert Mac Donald needs our help! Of course, he would never ask for
  it so we are starting a Fundrazr in hopes we can donate and raise
  enough money for him to get dentures. He is so tired of Hotpockets and
  mashed potatos :) Seriously though, no one should have to live a life
  without teeth. Bob moved out to Portland this year to be closer to

  never delivered. He drove down to California this month in hopes they
  could help and we just found out it is not going to happen through the

"Thomas's Fight Continues On September 18, 2012, nine-year old Thomas was diagnosed with
  Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS). ARMS is a rare cancer of the muscles
  and connective tissues affecting only 350 children annually. Early
  detection is nearly impossible, and sadly, the cancer had spread to
  his bones and spine by the time it was detected. But Thomas is much
  more than this disease. He's an incredibly sweet boy with a smile that
  warms your heart. He is a huge Seahawks fan and has played pee-wee
  football in both New York and Virginia. He received a year's worth of treatment of chemo and radiation
  at VCU Children's Hospital in Richmond and was in remission at the end
  of his treatment in October of 2013. Unfortunately, in September
  of 2014, Thomas relapsed and is currently undergoing another round of
  chemotherapy at the hospital. His family faces extensive medical bills as a result, with only
  one parent able to work because of stays and treatments at the
  hospital. Please find it in your hearts to help Thomas and his family

"Update on Josh, 2/2/16: The surgery at the Mayo Clinic in
  January went well. They were able to fully remove the tumor, but there
  are still microscopic cells that the doctors are concerned about. The
  tumor was grade 3 (originally thought to be grade 2). It was
  technically found to be a mixture of grade 2 and 3, but the doctors
  classify tumors as the most severe grade they find within it - so
  grade 3 in this case. Next steps will be 6 weeks of chemo and radiation at the Mayo,
  and Josh/Kara/Knightley will likely stay at The Hope Lodge in
  Rochester since he needs treatments just about daily. Then following
  that, Josh and Kara (and Knightley) truly HOPE to go to SunRidge
  Medical Center in Arizona, a natural path center that does treatments
  such as ozone therapy, heavy metal detoxification, bio identical
  replacement, and more. Josh was using some natural path treatments
  before his surgery, and when they closed the incision there was no
  scarring. Plus he was able to recover quickly enough to be released
  from the hospital in just two days (his 8+ hour surgery was on
  Tuesday, and then he was released on Thursday). Josh and Kara's goal is to go to SunRidge Medical Center within
  the next year...but the reason for hesitation is because they cannot
  afford it on their own. The cost of the treatments would be $60,000
  (since it is a natural path option and insurance doesn't any of cover
  it). The family has done a lot of research, and they've found SunRidge
  has the best alternative treatments and has one the highest levels of
  experience out there. They are getting close to a cure for brain
  cancer. The FDA has approved stage one treatments. The BIG reason for desiring this option is because these
  treatments are what could prevent the tumor from returning. Josh's
  type of tumor is almost guaranteed to return every 5-15 years - and
  the concern is that it might not be removable. Josh's little family humbly asks that if you feel led to donate,
  they would appreciate it beyond words!! We are all trusting is the
  Lord, and also trying to make the best tangible decisions to protect
  Josh and allow him to provide for his family. If 300 people would be able to give $100, they would be half way
  to their goal! Any amount is appreciated more than you could ever
  know. Please share, and prayers are appreciated!! Note: If you are able to write a personal check, the money ALL
  goes to Josh + Kara, rather than this site keeping a fee to run this.
  If you want to give that way, you can send it here: Josh Farnam 19417 Memory
  Circle Hutchinson, MN 55350 Original: Josh Farnam is a caring husband and father, and
  is the primary provider for his family. On Sunday, October 25th early
  in the morning, Josh had a grand mal seizure and was rushed to the
  hospital. After numerous tests and an MRI, the doctors discovered a
  brain tumor. They have determined the tumor is Grade 2 Astrocytoma. They are
  still determining Josh's treatment -- at the Mayo Clinic. Prior to his seizure, Josh was working two full-time jobs. One
  was an existing job, and the other was a second job that he was
  testing out on a trial period to see if it would be a better fit for
  his career progression. On Thursday before the seizure, he was offered
  permanent employment by the second company, and he put in his
  two-weeks notice with the first company. At the time of the seizure,
  he was employed by both companies. That said, given issues with the
  insurance paperwork, Josh was between health insurance coverage, and
  was working to get it figured out. Then this all happened. Josh's dad
  was thankfully able to get him onto his health insurance (becuase Josh
  is currenly under 26). He is now employed doing work from home and we
  are very thankful for that. Medical Needs: The testing, nights in the hospital, the
  biopsy, and all future treatment needs (brain surgery) will be
  expensive, and insurance assistance from Josh's dad's health insurance
  is still being determined. At minimum, there will be a sizable
  deductible the family will need to cover. Family Needs: The family will have a number of financial
  needs during this time, including basic living expenses such as
  providing for 1 year-old Knightley, food, and other expenses. Any prayer and financial assistance is incredibly welcomed!! #getjoshbetter","10,724",of $70k goal,https://fundrazr.com/713k3e,Josh Farnam's Brain Tumor Fundraiser,85,,U.S. Dollar

"Most people have heard about the benefits of meditation. It can
  improve sleep, diminish anxiety, soften depression, anger, and fear.
  People who meditate regularly report sharper focus, more patience,
  improved memory and relationships. As a daily practice meditation can
  truly change your life (even creating new neural pathways in the
  brain) and is widely known to help many mental illnesses. My name is Sam and I've been studying Buddhism and meditation for
  about 4 years. I first discovered Buddhism when I was in high school
  and I read Brad Warner's Hardcore Zen on a long ride to Vermont for
  family vacation. The book changed my life and I was able to heal many
  of my issues with anger and resentment at an early age because of
  Warner's straightforward introduction to Zen practice. I first tried
  my hand at meditating during this time but I never fully committed to
  daily practice until I reached college During my first year of college I experienced a crippling depressive
  episode that landed me in therapy as I sought relief from my
  relentless anxiety and emotional numbness. Although talk therapy was
  helpful, I found true relief when I met my first Zen teacher, Ryan
  Joo. Ryan was a Buddhist monk from Korea, and I took his class as an
  elective. Through his teaching and instruction I gained an even deeper
  understanding of Buddhism and the different schools of Zen. I began to
  come out of my shell of anxiety, panic, and sadness when I embraced
  meditation as a daily practice. I left college after a year but
  remained grateful for the tools I had gained from therapy and from
  Ryan's class. I took my meditation practice with me and through it was
  able to treat my ongoing panic attacks and survived many painful
  experiences through daily meditation and reflective practice. Now I live in New York City and have been very lucky to find the
  DharmaPunx community sangha. Meditating with DharmaPunx gave me my
  first opportunity to meet other practitioners and learn different
  forms of meditation. As my practice and understanding has grown, I've
  learned more about the Thervavada tradition of Buddhism which is the
  school of Buddhism DharmaPunx's teacher, Josh Korda, is empowered in.
  I've found a great deal of fulfillment, healing, and joy in the weekly
  DharmaPunx meetings and have committed even more deeply to meditation.
  For many years I knew I would like to someday attend a meditation
  retreat, but I wanted to wait until I was ready and felt I was skilled
  enough in my practice. I feel that time has finally come, and it's a
  very exciting time for me as a practitioner! With DharmaPunx's springtime retreat at the Garrison Institute
  approaching this May, I'm excited and thankful to say I received a
  scholarship to participate in the retreat. However, the scholarship
  will not fully cover the cost and so I am asking for help in paying
  the remainder of the cost of attendence. 300 dollars may not sound
  like much, but as a hairstylist assistant living on my own, paying
  back student loans as well as all of my bills at 22 years old, finding
  that total chunk of money in one payment will be challenging. All the
  money I recieve will go towards the remaining cost of room/board and
  meals. I am asking for your help in sending me to the Garrison
  Institute to meditate this May so I can deepen my spiritual practice
  without causing myself stress and anxiety during a time that is meant
  to be focused on balance and reflective practices. As I continue down my path with meditation I hope to eventually start
  my own casual mediation group where I can teach other people my age
  about Buddhism, meditation, and contemplative practices so that they
  too can live happier, more balanced lives that are free from excess
  suffering and anxiety. Meditation is a practice that not only benefits the individual
  sitting but every individual that the practitioner might meet in their
  daily life. Meditation makes us more compassionate, more patient, and
  more forgiving with others. Meditation does not harm others or the
  practitioner, it does not use up resources, nor does it exploit,
  demand, or compete. Meditation is a blameless practice that can bring
  hope, peace, and healing to all beings. Please donate to my fund and help me experience this important step
  in my path. Thank you!",115,of $300 goal,https://fundrazr.com/b17E14,Help Sam Meditate at the Garrison Institute!,4,,U.S. Dollar
"Hi guys, I'm hoping to fundraise for my son Lucas, who has spastic
  quadriplegic cerebral palsy, otherwise known as four limb cerebral
  palsy. This means his arms & legs are stiff, but his core is weak.
  Lucas was born at 30 weeks gestation, weighing a tiny 2lbs 14oz. There
  were complications during labour which led to myself suffering an
  internal haemorrhage & a placental abruption. This means the
  placenta came away from my womb, stopping Lucas receiving the oxygen
  and blood he needed. He was born by emergency c-section on the 14th
  September 2014. Lucas stayed in the baby intensive care unit for 7
  weeks. Everything seemed to be going straightforward, however on the
  day of his discharge, he had a routine brain scan which showed that he
  had severe brain damage on both sides of his brain, and would have
  cerebral palsy. We were told he may not sit, walk, talk, or eat
  properly. Lucas is now 18 months old-however developmentally he is
  scoring at 3-4 months old. He is unable to roll over, sit up, reach or
  play with toys or toddle around like other 18 month old boys would do.
  He uses a special chair for meal times to give him the extra support
  he needs, and he has hand splints to help open up his hands. We would
  love to raise money to take Lucas to the Bobath centre in London for
  children with cerebral palsy, and also any specialist equipment he
  will need in the future. Physio at the Bobath Centre involves daily
  intense physio with highly trained physiotherapists who have vast
  experience in CP. He would greatly benefit from this treatment,
  However it is very expensive. So any donations towards this would be

    contribution you can spare would most appreciated - Nicole :) Nothing brings a family to it’s knees like a sick kid. We would
  dearly like your help to give young Aaron a chance at a normal life. Up until about March 2012 we were travelling along as a normal
  family, our son Aaron was 14,  doing well at school work – a healthy,
  active teenage boy playing soccer and basketball with friends and
  school teams. Then something changed, Aaron began to experience severe allergies.
  We took Aaron to doctors, but none of the medication or dietary
  changes seemed to help much at all. Then Aaron caught a flu which
  ended up getting so bad that it almost became pneumonia. The doctors
  put him on antibiotics which seemed to kill the infection and reduce
  the tightness on his chest, but after approximately 2 weeks the
  severity of the virus returned and he was put onto more antibiotics
  (which we normally would not need to use). At this time Aaron’s health took a nosedive. He was experiencing
  nausea and pain and unable to eat properly. Aaron felt his stomach
  beating as a heart and the next medical merry-go-round began. Though
  his stomach began to get better, Aaron became weak and sore all over.
  After many doctors and numerous tests nobody was able to give us a
  diagnosis. We tried healthy foods, supplements, pushing past the pain,
  hospital tests, chiropractors and still Aaron is not getting any
  better, in fact he is getting worse, the pain so constant and severe
  is barely able to leave the house. It’s been more than two years since Aaron has been able to attend
  regular school, the pain is too severe. Aaron’s mother Julie has had
  to leave the workforce to care full-time for Aaron. With the doctors
  unable to provide any answers or a clear diagnosis, our family is
  struggling to make ends meet and with no clear diagnosis we are not
  eligible for government support. After spending 18 months of testing, caring, searching options and
  battling beureaucracy we had made little headway and had become tired,
  frustrated and desperate for answers. We have found a private clinic that is able to help with difficult
  cases, such as Aaron. With our financial resources exhausted over the
  last two years, we are reaching out to ask our community for help. We
  desperately want for Aaron to get well so he can live into the
  possibility of the young man he was on the way to becoming before he
  was struck down from this illness. We are so grateful to the support we have had over the last two years
  from friends, family and our community. If you can spare even a small

"Recently our clinic staff members have noticed a high number of monks
  coming to our clinic with gastro-intestinal difficulties ranging from
  digestion problems, constipation, bloating, persistent diarrhea, and
  abdominal pain. Due to this, one week ago an announcement was made
  during a general assembly asking all monks who have gastrointestinal
  issues to report to the clinic the following morning. To our surprise,
  over 60 monks showed up with varying symptoms and troubles. These issues ranged from simple constipation to more serious symptoms
  such as acute abdominal pain and swelling. Because of the wide array
  of possibles causes for all of these issues, and the often complex
  nature of gastrointestinal problems, it was decided that the best
  course of action was to bring each monk to the local hospital for a
  full diagnostic screening and treatment where needed. The local hospital has a special department for gastrointestinal
  health and is able to provide the proper care that our monks need
  regarding these health issues. Each initial screening and diagnostic
  at the gastro health department of the hospital will include a general
  health check-up, endoscopy, and colonoscopy if needed. Any recommended
  treatment or medication will also be provided as part of this project. The total projected cost for this project is 165,000 Rupees ($2579.28
  USD). Each complete screening costs 1500 Rupees ($23.45 USD), and we
  estimate another 1000 to 1200 Rupees (between $15 - $18 USD) for
  medications and transportation costs. This amounts to about 2700
  Rupees (about $42) for each monk for a total of 165,000 Rupees
  ($2,579.28). Our fundraiser goal is set a bit higher than our
  projected total cost due the the strong possibility that some of the
  monks will need additional medical care and services as follow-up to
  the health screening. We humbly ask for your help in providing these monks with this much
  needed care. You can choose to sponsor one or more monks for their
  medical costs, or make a general donation toward our goal. With your
  help, we get these monks back to proper health and also prevent some
  of these medical issues from growing worse if not treated when we now
  have the opportunity. With much gratitude and
  appreciation, Lobsang Gedun Shar Gaden Health Clinic Secretary.","3,080",of $3k goal,https://fundrazr.com/azuB8,Shar Gaden Clinic New Health Issue,46,,U.S. Dollar
"Hi. My name is Marilyn. I am 48 and have two sons and 4 stepchildren.
  Ive always loved life so it came as a shock In 2010 when I was
  diagnosed with ""young women's aggressive breast cancer"". I
  was told optomistically that it wouldnt be cancer, even before i was
  tested. unfortunately, they were wrong and it WAS cancer. I took it in
  my stride. They did a biopsy, but missed the cancer cells, so i had to
  go back in so they could take more tissue. the results came back that
  they hadnt got it all, so yet again i went back in. This happened 4
  times before i insisted the breast be removed by which time the cancer
  was wide spread (in the breast area). i recovered well for my
  masectomy, and went on to chemotherapy,and radiotherapy, which like
  most women, made me ill, but im a fighter and came back well, but in
  2013 i found another lump.The cancer had come back and was now
  terminal. I accepted every chemotherapy offered to me but my immune
  systyem is so broken down now from the first series of chemo, that my
  body rejected every chemotherapy, leaving me recently, with a life
  threatening infection. Recently, i was put in touch with a Dr from
  Germany, who believes he can treat me. The cost though, is around 5000
  euro's a week, and its a 3 week stay, plus the odd day here and there.
  I now need, desperately to raise around £10,687 asap. The money would
  go towards treatment and accomodation. The treatment includes the
  application of hyperthermia, Artemisinin-a chinese wormwood
  preperation,the application of Buserelin in combination with
  hyperthermia, also low dose of chemo and using thymus peptide
  injections, misletoe therapy, oxygen therapies, ozone own blood drips,
  magnetic fields therapies, and highly measured selenium and vitimin C
  therapy. The Dr has recommended a minimum of a 3 week stay, so i need
  to try to raise a minimum of around £10,678,33p, for my treatment. I
  am looking, with friends and family, at doing some events to try to
  raise money. My husband and I would pay for our own flights to keep
  costs down. Could you help me fight my cancer by donating and help
  raise the funds for this treatment. I am optomistic and still have
  fight left in me. I dont want this to go to waste, or i will feel it
  will have all been for nothing. I want to be able to take on any
  opportunity available to me for treatment. I know i can do this but i
  need your help too. Every donation helps.  Can you help me please.
  Payments can be made through paypal, or a bank account (details on
  request) cash, or cheque. We are also doing a collection service so if
  you wish to donate but would need someone to collect the money, then
  that can be arranged too. Many many thanks in advance, and i will keep
  you all posted with updates.","12,030",of £10.7k goal,https://fundrazr.com/b10bMf,can you help me fight my cancer with funds please?,195,,Pound Sterling
"Please join 19 Team Ride to Give athletes as they compete this
      weekend in Gilford, New Hampshire at the Timberman Sprint
      Triathlon on Saturday and Half-Ironman (70.3) on Sunday. Team RTG
      is competing for Trenton Blanchard, a bright 17 year old who
      suffers from Selective Mutism , a
      debilitating complex childhood anxiety disorder. Trenton is the first born son of Hannah and Craig Blanchard of
  Orange, MA. When he was two he became very sick. Trenton had been off
  and on for the previous 6 weeks, sleeping more than he was awake, and
  tired all the time. His pediatrician was dismissive but a trip to the
  ER proved Trenton was suffering from a large abscess that was pressing
  on his brain. He had emergency brain surgery in September 2000 and his
  parents feared they’d lose him. After surgery no one suggested to his
  parents that Trenton should receive early intervention services. It
  wasn't until he was three that they expressed their concerns about his
  speech, had a formal evaluation done, and finally began speech
  therapy. When Trenton started preschool he qualified for speech
  therapy and occupational therapy which helped, but his parents were
  still concerned with his lack of progress. When Trenton was 8 he started struggling at school. His therapist
  reported his age equivalent for speech was between the three and five
  year level at that time. He was difficult to understand, but with
  repetition he was generally able to make himself understood. Trenton
  complained that his teacher was mean and cried at night about going to
  school. He developed episodes of dizziness and feeling as if he was
  ""going in circles"". It was reported by his teachers that he
  would often refuse to speak, and would sometimes shut down, head on
  table, eyes closed, and ears covered. His parents believe age 8 was
  when he first started feeling anxiety, however his teachers were not
  sympathetic and insisted it was behavioral. In 2009 Trenton was referred by his neurologist to a special language
  doctor for his difficulty speaking at school. He was 11 years old when
  he was diagnosed with Selective Mutism. SM is an anxiety disorder
  characterized by a child's inability to speak and communicate
  effectively in select social settings, but not when home and relaxed.
  At that time, the only treatment that was offered for Trenton was an
  SSRI such as Prozac. Before trying mood altering medication, Trenton’s
  parents choose to share the diagnosis with his teachers and tried to
  educate them about SM so they could better teach their boy, but his
  disorder continued to progress. Some teachers were understanding
  but others thought discipline would get him to talk. He was taunted
  and bullied. School became torture for this sweet boy who was
    truly struggling. Mid way through 7th grade Trenton's mutism had progressed so much
  that he was not participating in family activities and he would not
  talk aloud at home anymore. He began to only whisper to his parents,
  so they tried Prozac which helped him talk freely at home. He remained
  mute in social settings and was humiliated by his wood working
  instructor for being silent at school, even though his teachers were
  educated about his condition. In 2014 Trenton had a complete neuropsychological evaluation. His
  doctor concluded that Trenton is not intellectually disabled as had
  been suggested in the past. She diagnosed a language based learning
  disability, receptive-expressive language disorder, as well as
  selective mutism. He currently speaks in only a few specific settings where he feels
  comfortable and relaxed. His failure to speak in most social
  situations is significantly impacting his educational, social and
  emotional functioning. Medication alone is not a complete treatment. Trenton’s parents have
  found an out of state therapist who specialized in Selective Mutism. Dr. Elisa Shipon-Blum , who is the
  President & Director of the Selective Mutism Anxiety Research and
  Treatment Center (SMART Center) located in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.
  Dr. Blum is the only doctor his parents have found that has developed
  a social communication therapy that has been proven to work for
  children with Selective Mutism. Sadly she does not accept health
  insurance and it is $2500.00 for the initial evaluation and $500 a
  month for the continued treatment plan. Trenton is nearly out of
  school so his situation is dire. He needs help NOW. Team Ride to Give is inspired by Trenton’s bravery and his
    desire to overcome SM. They will compete this weekend to
  raise enough funds to cover Dr. Blum’s initial evaluation and at least
  6 months of treatment. Please help us make a difference in this young
  man’s life and give him a fighting chance at a bright future. You can follow Trenton on his page ""Take back my Voice.""","7,782",of $7.5k goal,https://fund.ridetogive.com/711wn4,Team Ride to Give - Ironman Timberman Weekend,384,,U.S. Dollar
"Our Sister ""Vivian"" is a 47 year old woman with
  Leiomyosarcoma Cancer. This cancer is a very rare cancer that not much
  is known of it. She was diagnosed with Leiomyosarcoma cancer in 2012. Since then the
  cancer has spread to her bladder, lung, and lymphoid.  However, there
  is a bright side. In 2012 the day of diagnosis until 2013 she went to University of
  Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), and things were not getting any
  better.  They were giving her Neulasta shots which was to treat the
  cancer but was making her feel even worse.  She felt like giving up. One night she was crying and praying and a Cancer Treatment Centers
  of America commercial came on and she called at 12:00 Midnight.
   Someone took the call that night and got all the info they could then
  the next day they called back with good news.  She could come.  But
  she now wondered how is she going to pay for it. She went and they started taking care of her.  She was wondering why
  no one had given her a bill or said anything.  Then one day a bill
  come for $89,000.00 came. Panic stuck her heart! She called the Cancer
  Treatment Center of America Oklahoma to find out about the bill and to
  tell them that she could never pay this.  They informed her that she
  had a zero balance, and that an anonymous donor has taken care of her
  treatment there. Now that a bright side, Huh. Along with the battle against cancer, there is now another battle
  that has occurred.  The essentials of her life, so to say, are winning. She lost the house while getting treatments at UAMS and had to move
  into an apartment. She lost the daycare that she was running because
  she couldn't care for the children anymore. Now every night she has to take Chemo treatments at home until the
  next visit to the CTCA Oklahoma, where her husband drives her monthly
  for assessment and treatment.  These cost are not covered by the
  anonymous donor. Let me not forget to mention, food for the home, housing cost, caring
  for her son Brandon (school clothes, shoe, and supplies) and everyday
  essentials that we some time take for granted are in serious need for
  her right now. Which brings us to the reason for this request for your help?  Any

  pediatrician and being tested for everything under the sun, I brought
  Katie back into the pediatrician on February 4th because she started
  showing symptoms of meningitis. We were immediately sent to Scottish
  Rite for a spinal tap test to see if Katie actually had meningitis.
  The spinal tap came back clear but the ER doctor wanted to have a CT
  scan done to see where the pain was coming from in her neck. A few
  hours later we were sat down and told that Katie had a brain tumor.
  Our world came to a sudden stop! A neurologist came in and spoke with
  us and told us that Katie had a lot of pressure in her head and he
  wanted to drain the fluid pressure by performing minor surgery that
  night and putting a drain in her head. After the 45 minute surgery we
  were told that everything went great and they were very happy they put
  the drain in because the pressure in her head was 30% and normal
  pressure was 15-20%. The next day Katie had an MRI which revealed a
  total of 4 tumors. Three of the four were in her brain and one was on
  her brain stem, on her spine. The next day, Katie had emergency brain surgery, 8 hours long to
  remove the tumor that was on her brain stem on her spine. The doctors
  mentally prepared us for her to be completely unconscious for the next
  24-48 hours to control the swelling on her brain as well as having
  tubes in her and all over her body. When her surgery was complete the
  doctors came into the waiting room with the biggest smiles on their
  faces and said, ""She's awake, smiling, and talking...She's a
  FIGHTER!"" they couldn’t believe it!!! God and a ton of angels
  were watching over her that day. We stayed in the hospital for about 2
  1/2 weeks during her recovery. We were home for 2 weeks before we went
  back to the hospital to begin chemotherapy for next 6 months!  The
  first cycle of chemo went great until we got home. Four days into us
  being home Katie became very dehydrated, couldn’t keep any food,
  water, medicine, ect.in her system. She lost a lot of weight and
  became very pale. I took her into the ER and we ended up being in the
  hospital for 1 month and 1 day. Most of that time was spent in the
  PICU. One of the chemo drugs caused Katie's lining in her stomach to
  be torn out which is called typhlitis. She also had fluid buildup on
  her right lung which needed surgery to help drain the fluid.
  Throughout the two and half weeks in PICU, Katie’s heart rate was in
  the 225’s and she was also on oxygen for most of the time. We came
  very close to losing her but we weren’t going to let that happen!
  Eventually Katie’s oxygen levels went back to normal and her heart
  rate did as well. We were finally able to be moved back to the Aflac
  floor, where we spent the remainder of two weeks. Before going home
  Katie had a central line put in her chest for the last 3 cycles of
  chemo and stem cell transplant and a G-Tube put in her stomach to help
  with meds, feedings, hydrating, ect., it has been wonderful! The last 5 cycles of chemo have been great for Katie.She skated
  through her BMT chemo stay with flying colors!!!! We continue to treat
  Katie's tumor with oral chemo at home and will continue to do so over
  the next two years as she is in a high risk for relapsing in this time
  frame. We continue to get quarterly MRI's and weekly labs, and
  doctor visits to make sure Katie is in good health! Katie has had such
  a great mind set and spirit throughout this entire process! She is still the same loveable, sweet, energetic girl! We are hoping
  and praying that all goes well and after all that Katie has endured we
  can say, ""We Beat Cancer!!!"" (""Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the
    donee organization has complete discretion and control over the use

"Written by Valerie Henigson. In June 2014 Brandon was a happy,
  sociable 7 year old boy who loves superheros and played sports. Over
  the summer he received a devastating diagnosis- x linked
  adrenoleukodystrophy. This is a rare, genetic disease, it affects boys
  with an age of onset around 4-10 years of age. Prior to onset
  development is completely normal and screening has not been done
  routinely, that is just changing currently. X linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a serious, progressive disorder
  that affects the adrenal glands. Initial symptoms, which Brandon is
  already suffering, include; problems with learning, attention,
  behavior, vision, hearing, speech, balance and gait difficulties.
  Symptoms are rapidly progressive and can lead to severe disability,
  and a vegetative state. This is the condition portrayed so movingly in
  the film ""Lorenzo's Oil"". Brandon loves all superheros but he is Ironman's number one fan.
  Prior to these symptoms Brandon played soccer, baseball, basketball
  and swam. Now he has a 1:1 aide at school and private gym and recess
  to prevent injury. Things are going to get harder for Brandon and he
  needs our help to cope and get the best equipment and treatment for
  this disease, so he can remain comfortable and keep his superpowers as
  long as possible. Brandon's family needs financial support; there are medical
  expenses, prescriptions,travel expenses (the best treatment centers
  are in Maryland (Kennedy Krieger), and Minnesota).  Brandon will need
  specialized equipment and his parents will lose time from work in
  their efforts to care for him and to secure the best possible medical advice. Brandon lives with his parents, Paul and Liliana and his 4
  year-old brother, Brian. loves all superheros but especially Tony
  Stark, Ironman. We know Brandon would use his powers for good- he says
  when he grows up he wants to design videogames that are easier for
  little kids to play. Paul, Brandon's father, has a supportive second family at his job
  at Port Chester Middle School. He is truly the person who is there for
  everyone and loved by everyone. Knowing Paul for many years I know he
  will be moved more by the amount of people who care enough to
  contribute than by the dollar amount    collected, so please give
  whatever you can, no matter how small. If you are like me, you find it unbearable to feel helpless in the
  face of  this devastating tragedy. So let's give what we can to enrich
  and make comfortable the lives of Brandon and his family while we can.
  Let's help Brandon adapt and hold onto his superpowers as long as
  possible. Thank you. As I am writing this, I got a text from Paul;
  Brandon was just rushed to the hospital via helicopter. Please help as
  soon as possible. Thank you again.","9,055",,https://fundrazr.com/7rPK0,Help Superhero Brandon fight adrenoleukodystrophy,,,
"This fundraiser was started for Jen Dawson, who has Ehlers-Danlos
  Syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is inherited and lifelong.
  EDS is a group of connective tissue disorders, caused by various
  defects in the synthesis of collagen that the body uses to provide
  strength and elasticity to tissue so it can be stretched, but not
  beyond its limit, and then safely return that tissue to normal. There
  are six distinct types of EDS, but a number of mutations with a
  multitude of symptoms and manifestations. Typically a person is
  diagnosed with just one type of EDS that they most closely fit. Jen,
  however, has actually been diagnosed with three of those types:
  Classical, Hypermobility, and Kyphoscoliosis. Among her symptoms, there is generalized joint hypermobility, where
  her joints move beyond the joint's normal range. The loose and
  unstable joints are prone to frequent sprains, strains, and joint
  subluxations and dislocations. This type of instability leads to the
  early onset of degenerative osteoarthritis and chronic, debilitating
  musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain that is often out of proportion
  to physical and radiological findings. Severely weak muscle tone with
  the joint laxity has led to delayed gross motor development, severe
  progression in the curvature of her spine resulting in pain and
  trouble breathing, as well as weakness in the legs that will progress
  to paralysis resulting in loss of ambulation in the second or third
  decade. Her skin hyper-extensibility led to her having fragile skin
  that tears and bruises easily, with severe scarring, and with slow and
  poor wound healing. This is true not just with the surface of
  her skin, but all manner of tissue throughout the rest of her body. Currently, there is no cure for EDS, so medical intervention is
  limited to taking measures to slow the progression of syptoms, which
  include the restriction of various activities and treatment of
  the symptoms. While Jen's symptoms started from birth, the first
  serious incident was when she was in the seventh grade and she had a
  knee dislocation that was so severe it broke her femur. That led to
  the first of many surgeries. From there, it took five years to get a
  diagnosis as she went from hospital to hospital and doctors dismissed
  everything, saying it was all in her head, it was her attempt at
  seeking attention, and it was drug-seeking behavior. It wasn't until
  she was 12 years old that she was properly diagnosed and that was five
  years lost from early medical intervention. With all of her medical problems associated with EDS, she could no
  longer be so active in sports and other physical activities as she was
  prior to her first surgery. It also took three extra years for her to
  graduate, which included two years of being home-bound and then her
  taking adult education in order to get her diploma. In total, Jen has
  had 32 knee surgeries, 5 bilateral wrist and hand surgeries, as well
  as a fusion of her left thumb due to her EDS. Her EDS has progressed
  to the point that, just last fall, her doctors determined that it was
  medically necessary for her to move permanently from Michigan to
  Georgia in order to avoid another typical Michigan winter that would
  have resulted in her being confined to a permanent wheelchair.",580,of $2k goal,https://fundrazr.com/9xeX8,Team Jen Medical Expense Fundraiser!,28,,U.S. Dollar

"Greetings all. As most of you know, I became a Double Amputee on
  Halloween 2014. After two long hospital stays and three surgeries, I am still here! I have a long uphill battle ahead of me; I battle pain daily, the wound is still healing. Learning that I have many obstacles and limitations to overcome. I am trying to find a new kind of normal. I am working hard to be independent, despite my many limitations. It is extremely hard for an above the knee amputee to learn to walk,
  it is even harder for a DOUBLE above the knee amputee to walk, and
  being in my late 50’s doesn’t help. One of the hardest things for me to face each day is the OVERWHELMING cost for me just to be able to walk again. I have to start out on “shortys/stubbies” prosthetics. This type of
  prosthetics has no knee and is only about 2 feet tall. The cost is $45,000 EACH. These will be used just to learn
  to walk; I will have to graduate to regular prosthetic legs. I already
  have one prosthetic leg (which has cost me $125,000 to date) and I
  will require a second leg at the same cost or more. What this boils
  down two is that I am looking at $215,000 just for the
  equipment . This does not take in account all of the rehab and
  doctors’ costs. I do have insurance, but I am responsible for
    20%, that is $43,000! I am appealing to all of my friends to please help me in my Fundrazr

"I'm 28 and live in Brighton with Chris my boyfriend and Jamie our
  beloved cat - she's snuggled me through many difficult times when I
  lived alone previously. I have Asymetric Spastic Quadreplegia type
  cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy affects both my arms and legs making my
  muscles stiff and painful, but also very uncooperative when I want to
  move and my balance is poor meaning I can fall and hurt myself. Despite the challenges cerebral palsy presents I try to live an
  active a life as possible, I have a fiercely determined spirit and
  like to get around independently as best I can. But in the last year
  my health has significantly declined after a fall and I desperately
  need some private intensive physiotherapy twice a week for a year and
  possibly on going, to reclaim my mobility, independence and freedom
  and I NEED YOUR HELP! Yesterday my lovely tricycle which I have nicknamed 'Steed - the
  helping bicycle'. Steed was stolen from outside our property while
  Chris was in the process of changing the saddle, with the hope of me
  being more comfortable when I ride. Sadly this isn't the first time
  the bike has been stolen. Last time it was found by a member of the
  public and reported to the police after a successful Facebook campaign
  for it's safe return. Again we appealed to friends, family and the
  local community via Facebook and Twitter. The response from everyone
  near and far has been so supportive and understanding, and there's a
  real determination to find Steed wherever she is! We hope if it
  doesn't return we will be able to claim on our household insurance as
  it is specifically insured. However, if the insurance company don't
  come forward then we'll need to organise a replacement. It's been really wonderful. I feel so fortunate to live in such a
  caring community. Honestly the support I have received has been
  incredible. So many messages of support. We gave her a good spring clean and I did have two rides on Steed the
  evening before she was stolen, despite the uncomfortable seat I still
  felt free and knew we were not far from having Steed in a perfect
  condition and ready to take me on adventures.  It seemed that the
  opportunity to increase my fitness and go anywhere I wanted
  independently was within touching distance. Then she was stolen! I
  hope the tricycle will find its way home to me soon. We have been really touched by the generous spirit of everyone who
  has responded to the theft of the tricycle. Sadly I have struggled to
  ride much at all as after a bad fall just before Christmas in which I
  hurt my hip. I have barely been able to walk confidently since and
  have needed support of someone holding my hand just to get around the
  flat. A stark contrast from when I could, on one of my good days, walk
  to the local shops and carry a small amount of shopping on my back unaided. It's been hard to keep my spirits up and depression at bay, but I've
  got a strong network of friends and family who keep me going. I want
  to get well enough to work and travel with Chris. I love life and want
  to be able to make the most of it and be in the best health I can. I had major surgery at 14 years old and had to take 18 months to
  recover and relearn to walk. So it's sad to have lost so much of the
  confidence in my walking and independence I worked so hard for. I want
  to get it back and am determined to do whatever it takes. But I NEED
  YOUR HELP! Unfortunately the physiotherapy provided by the NHS is wholly
  inadequate for my needs now I'm an adult. It's like I've been given
  all this support as a child and teenager and then just left in the
  wilderness to get on as best I could with physiotherapy by myself. It
  seems such a false economy as sometimes I ask what was all the pain I
  went through for, and all the money that the NHS invested to help me
  if now I'm stuck at home on the sofa almost totally reliant on my
  wheelchair when I want to go out; and not strong enough to work or
  raise a family in the future or travel which are all things we want to do. I spend a lot of my time napping on the sofa as the pain medication
  is making me so tired. It's not that I don't want to get moving, I do,
  but when I take a step often the pain in my hip is so sudden and sharp
  like a shard of glass that if I walk unaided I fall because of the pain. Believe me I have tried many rounds of NHS physiotherapy to make the
  best of things. But with the system as it is, physiotherapists seem to
  hardly want to touch or stretch my muscles now I'm an adult. The short
  bursts of 8 sessions of physiotherapy are all focused on getting me
  out of the clinic as soon as possible before I'm discharged again and
  have to wait for months for a re-refferal. The cycle is so exhausting
  and frustrating and not even providing the kind of physiotherapy I
  need. One physio suggested I stood next to the counter and stood for
  as long as I could as if that alone was going to be a solution to
  getting strong, another GP suggested I tie my hair back and drink more
  coffee! When I spoke to another physiotherapist for one private
  session I had in September she was appalled by the treatment I had,
  and hadn’t received. So I'm looking to the support of my communityand family and friends
  to help me. I promise I will make you proud and find a way to pass on
  the good vibes and do something good for the community when I am stronger! I am looking to initially fund one year's worth of private
  physiotherapy and a new tricycle too, if it comes to it that mine is
  not found. Every pound and penny will mean so much. I can't do this
  alone, but I will work so hard to get back on my feet and
    ready for adventures!",755,of £8.5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/011os4,Raising Money for Ali,17,,Pound Sterling
"In December 2014,after many months of pain and discomfort, Maryann
  was this diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Her tough battle to beat
  this dreaded disease started right away. First there were 6 weeks of

  removed. Now almost 10 weeks post surgery Maryann is waiting for the
  next round of chemotherapy to begin. The expectation is for another 26
  to 28 weeks of chemotherapy to ensure she has beaten dreaded disease. Maryann is an exceptionally kind person. She devotes her time to her
  husband, Philip, who has cerebral palsy and the clients she cares for
  in her career as a homecare worker. Accepting the kindness of others
  was one of her biggest challenges.  She is so accustomed to being the
  giver that being on the receiving end was tough for her to deal with. Maryann stopped working in early January and her medical coverage
  that helps pay for drugs ended at that time as well.  In May her EI
  benefits ran out - after 15 weeks. She is not expected to return to
  work until January 2016. Last week her husband Phillip also was laid
  off by his employer. Now added to the stress of healing and recovery
  is financial stress.  Maryann's mom and dad were staying with Maryann
  to help care for her and 3 weeks ago her mom fell and broke her hip.
  Maryann has struggled to visit her mom everyday in the hospital - a
  testament for her caring for others above herself. Please, send any prayers, love, and positive thoughts that you
  can—and if you are willing and able to donate financially, please
  consider doing so here. No amount is too small – $5, $10, $20 – every
  amount helps. If you can't afford to donate funds perhaps you can
  share the link so that others can help support Maryann in her
  recovery. Any little bit helps. If you know Maryann and Phillip, then
  you know that when this storm passes, they will pay it forward, in so
  many ways. Many thanks and God bless.","2,190",of $15k goal,https://fundrazr.com/d10ere,"Maryann (Leyte) Hunter's Fight - ""Together We Win""",44,,Canadian Dollar
"Hello friends. My name is Deonna Johnson . I am
  launching this fundraiser campaign on behalf of my daughter Anaya R. Williams. Last June, 2014, my daughter. Anaya was outside playing basketball
  with her friends. Everything seemed to be going well, when all of a
  sudden Anaya fell . She cried and yelled out: ""My
  leg! My leg!"" She was in excruciating pain. I
  immediately took her to the hospital EMERGENCY ROOM for evaluation. After long hours in the ER, medication, worrying and
  MUCH PRAYERS, the X-Ray results were finally in. The
  doctor came back and said, ""Your daughter, Anaya is fine! She
  just TORE A MUSCLE."" That was music to my ears. I have never had
  nor experienced any type of injury , as a child or
  young adult, so I assumed I was being told the right information. After a couple months, I noticed ANAYA'S walk was a
  lot DIFFERENT. Her hip looked like it has shifted . So I took my daughter back in to the same hospital. What a coincidence: the same
  doctor is on duty this day. So I explained to him how
  Anaya's walk is VERY DIFFERENT and her BOTTOM HAS
  SHIFTED. More test were run and again the same results. This time, he TOLD me, ""It's part of the healing process. That I should expect her to walk
  funny."" Me, not being a medical expert, I said ""Okay!""
  I just want the best care for my daughter. So I went
  on my way. Now it is the month of October. Five long months have passed and
  Anaya's walk seemed to be getting worse to me. Many people said,
  (friends and family) ""You're over exaggerating!"" But I know
  my child. I make her a doctor's appointment for her primary physician.
  Dr. Atiya does a physical exam on Anaya. He
  repeatedly asked Anaya to squat , bend , stand , and walk . Her was very thorough! Dr. Atiya noticed what I was noticed and start asking questions. He immediately referred Anaya out to see a Orthopedic specialist . Later on that night, Anaya
  yells, ""MOM!"" I rush downstairs to her. She is crying
  hysterically. I tried to calm her down so I know
  what's going on. She explains to me how she can't lift up her left leg . OMG! Now I'm
  really scared! I carried my frantic daughter to the car and RUSHED her back to the SAME HOSPITAL . It's a different
  doctor on duty tonight. I explain to the doctor what's going on and he
  began to run serial test. Long hours of waiting again, then results
  came in. My heart is pumping and I have a bad gut feeling. The doctor asked me again, what happened. (I explained it all again)
  Then I ask, ""What's is happening to my daughter?"" He tells
  me he see something he needs to call an orthopedic doctor. He tried to
  explain to me what's happening with my daughter. All
  I hear is: she needs surgery NOW ! Anaya is being
  rushed to Rady's Children Hosptial, San Diego. The Orothopic doctor asks me a lot of questions. Now she is getting
  the results of X-Ray's from June, August, and
  October . Her attuide changed immediately after viewing the
  history of Anaya's medical plight. She is now actually yelling:
  ""How can they do this to this child?"" I see the problem AND
  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED!"" Now, I""m extremely worried.
  She tells me how my daughter has a conditon called SCFE . ( Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis ) SCFE is an unusual
  DISORDER OF THE ADOLESCENT HIP. For reasons that are not well
  understood, the ball at the upper end of the femur ( thigh
  bone ) slips off in a backward direction.
  This is due to WEAKNESS OF THE GROWTH PLATE. She was amazed that Anaya
  was still walking up until this night. She go's on to tell me how Anaya's chance for a hip
    replacement is 72% . She will do all she can to save her hip now! Anaya had surgery !
  The condition caused her to be in a wheelchair for a
  few weeks, crutches 8 weeks, and physical therapy 5 months. Although
  Anaya had insurance, her surgery wasn't fully
  covered . So with my remaining savings, I had paid for what
  wasn't covered. Even though I wasn't financially prepared for this, I still needed to take care of my daughter,
  fulltime. I am all she has! Now, Anaya NEEDS the hip replacement surgery. The
  first procedure was to prevent her bones from detaching. Medical pins
  were placed in between her hip and leg bone.
  Anaya's SURGERY is
  scheduled for August, 2015. MY FAMILY NEEDS
    YOUR HELP ! I am the mother of FOUR CHILDREN! I can't do
  this on my own! I am reaching out to the community of friends,
  confident that together, we can reach the campaign goal to allow my
  daughter to have a normal life.  I ask you to lift her up in prayer for strength, speedy recovery, and God's favor to pour
  out on her. Needless to say, this FINANICAL GOAL would help tremedously. The funds raised will cover her surgery , wheelchair equipment, physical therapy , x-rays and road

"Qu'est-ce que la dystrophie facio-scapulo- humérale? La dystrophie facio-scapulo-humérale (FSH) est une maladie qui
  affecte les muscles squelettiques. C’est une maladie dégénérative, ce
  qui signifie que les symptômes s’aggravent avec le temps. Chez la
  plupart des personnes, les symptômes de la maladie se manifestent
  généralement à l’adolescence et affectent surtout les muscles du
  visage (du latin facio), des épaules (muscles scapulaires, fixateurs
  des omoplates) et des bras (muscles huméraux) ainsi que les muscles
  des jambes. La maladie peut graduellement limiter les activités
  personnelles et professionnelles des personnes atteintes. Il n’existe
  pour l’instant aucun traitement capable d’en ralentir, stopper ou
  enrayer les symptômes. Après la dystrophie musculaire de Duchenne et
  la dystrophie myotonique, la dystrophie FSH se classe au troisième
  rang des dystrophies les plus répandues. Touchant les femmes aussi
  bien que les hommes. Au Canada, son incidence est estimée à environ un
  cas sur 20 000. Pourquoi la course? Audrey-Maude est une mordue d’activités physiques, hicking, course,
  kayak, etc. Ne pouvant plus faire ce genre d’activités seule, elle m’a
  proposé de faire des demi-marathons en courant derrière moi. Autrement
  dit, de courir en me poussant dans mon fauteuil roulant. Pour être
  franche, lorsque qu’elle m’a parlé de faire des courses avec elle,
  l’idée ne m’enchantait pas plus qu’il faut. Au début je craignais le
  regard des gens face à la différence. Nous voyons rarement des gens à
  mobilité réduite lors d’évènements physiques. Les services et
  l’équipement pour le sport adapté ne sont pas accessibles pour tous
  les budgets et souvent les produits se trouvent aux États-Unis. J’ai
  la chance d’avoir un père très manuel qui nous a fabriqué une chaise
  roulante à trois roues pour nous permettre de courir ensemble. Dès la première course, toutes les appréhensions que j’avais sont
  tombées. Je me suis sentie si vivante! Même si ce n’est pas moi qui
  court et qui transpire pour franchir la ligne d’arrivée, je fais
  partie d’une équipe. Je suis présente sur la piste de course, je
  reçois les encouragements, je vois le sourire des gens, c’est comme si
  moi aussi je courais. C’est difficile à décrire, lors d’une course
  tout me semble possible, je me sens fière de moi, je ne m’arrête pas
  parce que je suis en fauteuil, je fonce, je suis à l’extérieur avec
  tout le monde. L’IRONMAN est un défi non seulement personnel, mais d’équipe! Nous
  voulons montrer aux gens qu’il y a quelqu’un assis dans le fauteuil
  roulant et que cette personne est vivante. Nous sollicitons votre aide pour financer nos billets et l’équipement
  supplémentaire requis pour nous permettre de faire le défi IRONMAN.

  in her life, yet with support of people around her she has managed to
  make it to university and is now about to finish her Bachelors degree
  with great results. Just as she started her final three month of internship, she fell ill
  due to a sharp pain in her lower abdomens, which had been there for a
  few weeks, but now became crippling. She visited the local hospital, only to find out she has a fist-size
  growth on her ovary, which needs to me removed soon. We are not yet
  sure if it is ovarian cancer or not at this stage, but it needs to be
  removed anyway. She and nobody around her has the money to pay for
  this surgery, which is expected to cost between 250.000 and 300.000

  that due to the size and potential that it is an Ovarian Cancer, time

  question its ligitimity. We understand. That is why we will try to

"Our community is a close-knit one and many of us know Ted Taylor
  through the years he worked at the courthouse.  Many more know Laura
  through her years as a court reporter. A little over 15 years ago Ted received a kidney transplant, fought
  hard and came back from that stronger than ever; in the following
  years though he faced continued battles with issues related to the
  transplant.  One of them was squamous cell carcinomas.  Then, in 2014,
  another spot appeared on his nose which quickly spread and moved
  through a cranial nerve.   His care was transferred to M.D. Anderson
  Cancer center and on February 17, 2015 he underwent surgery to remove
  the mass and surrounding tissue. So many of you have asked how you can help - the answer so far has
  been to continue to pray and send your best thoughts in their
  direction.  The Taylors are blessed in many ways and have been touched
  by the outpouring of support from family and friends.  Ted, Laura and
  their family believe that those prayers have been answered!  Ted has
  responded amazingly well following the lengthy and extensive surgery;
  he is now home recovering.  Soon though, he will be returning to
  Houston to begin weeks of radiation and continued treatment. We keep thinking there are more ways we can help, and although they
  are reluctant to accept any monetary donations, we would like to
  nevertheless contribute in any small way possible to offset the
  tremendous and mounting expenses that come with extended chronic
  illness and ongoing treatment.  If any of you would like to
  participate, we have set up an account to show Ted and the Taylors our
  love and support.  Our hope is that it will offer a little comfort
  while easing the financial burdens as they continue to bravely battle on.","6,610",of $50k goal,https://fundrazr.com/0wymc,Together for the Taylors.,44,,U.S. Dollar
"This campaign is dedicated to my beautiful wife Selena Prince. In 1997, my wife was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, it's an inflammatory
  disease that affects one or more organs, but most commonly affects the
  lungs. It is estimated that four in 10,000 people in the U.S. have
  sarcoidosis. Since then, her condition has progressed slowly. In 2008,
  my wife was given just months to live. Through the power of prayer and
  her strong will, seven years later she is still with us, however,
  sarcoidosis has completely consumed her lungs. She is on oxygen now,
  because her lungs only produce at 10% of their capacity. She spends
  more time in the hospital than in the comfort of our home. Unfortunately, there's no cure for her condition...only an extremely
  risky and challenging double-lung transplant can save her life. The
  good news is since my wife's condition has progressed she will be
  placed on the national organ donors list United Network for Organ
  Sharing. The surgeons at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) are up
  to the task. The problem is the operation costs $1.3
  million. Money we just don't have. Medical insurance covers a
  smaller portion of the cost than we originally expected. We've
  exhausted all our resources...so, I'm turning to you. It will take
  between 15 to $20,000 to take care of her medical expenses and move
  her from the Atlanta area to Durham, NC for pre and post operation
  care. Time is of the essence. Duke Pulmonary Transplant Clinic
  requires my wife relocate to manage her care and have half of
    the total by August 20th and the balance before the
  transplant, no exceptions. I'm not one to ask for handouts, but I really have nowhere else to
  turn. I realize times are hard for everyone, but any donation would be
  greatly appreciated. You can donate anonymously. If you can't make a

  privilege for granted. Those diagnosed with MS are less fortunate.
  They may have trouble doing even the simplest physical activity, like walking. I am asking you to support me in Bike MS: Waves to Wine Ride because
  this cause is meaningful to me. Multiple sclerosis is an
  unpredictable, often disabling, disease of the central nervous system
  that interrupts the flow of information within the brain, and between
  the brain and body. Millions of people are affected by MS and the
  challenges of living with its unpredictable symptoms, which range from
  numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis. The progress,
  severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be
  predicted, but advances in research and treatment are moving us closer
  to a world free of MS. Why You Should Sponsor Me: I am committed to training and completing 175 miles in one weekend,
  September 26-27. I will also focus the emotional energy I get from
  both your generous support and completing the race to help spread
  awareness about MS. Currently there is no cure for MS. The money that is raised will be
  used to find the cause, treatment, and ultimately the cure for
  multiple sclerosis. The money is also used to provide education,
  information, direct financial support, and scholarships to individuals
  and families living with MS. Let’s move forward together… please join me in the movement to do

  service dog, Finnigan!  Liane is one of those relativey rare people
  who genuinely cares about others and makes everyone feel welcome.  If
  you know her, you know exactly what I mean!  She gives of herself
  tirelessly to anyone in need and seeks to help wherever she can.  Each
  summer she spends several weeks at various Bible Camps helping out as
  the camp nurse, and in the winter makes trips up north on the ice
  roads to deliver supplies to people in need. She does all this despite facing significant health issues, including
  both MS and cancer, that impact the quality of her life and that, at
  times, see her bedridden.  To get around she depends upon a
  specialized wheelchair.  Unfortunately her wheelchair burned in a
  vehicle fire last month and was not covered by insurance.  Her ability
  to serve others, as well as to attend to her own needs, has been
  severely restricted by this loss.  I would like to see if we could
  help her rediscover her mobility, freedom and independence, by raising
  enough money to allow her to purchase a new wheelchair. These wheelchairs cost $23,000.00 brand new.  Let's face it ... to
  most of us, and certainly to Liane, that is not money that we having
  lying around.  Liane has found a used one that can be adjusted to suit
  her needs for significantly less.  If you can help us raise just
  $9000.00 we can help Liane get rolling again! $9000 is still a fairly significant amount of money but let's try to
  put that in perspective.  If 900 people gave just $10.00 each, Liane
  could be mobile again.  If 450 people gave $20.00 each, Liane would
  regain her freedom.  And it would only take 180 people, giving $50.00
  each, for Liane to experience her independence once more. What do you think?  Are you able to help?  A gift of any amount is
  greatly appreciated and will make a world of difference for our

"Hi, Meet my husband Tracy Boettcher and I am his wife, Amy, married 37
  years and full time 24/7 caregiver for him the past 4 years.  After
  his diagnosis of ALS we were both forced to close our businesses and
  tend to health needs as our full time unpaid, very expensive jobs. We
  moved away from our home, most of our family and all our friends, to
  Dallas, TX where we LOVE being with our grandchildren and kids. But
  boy, oh boy, do we miss all we left back home in Peoria, Illinois. Lack of Quality of Life is the #1 killer of those with ALS according
  to what doctors told us. Friends and Family ARE our lives. The best thing for anyone's health is to be surrounded by those who
  love you.  The  Internet is a great way to keep in touch but
  is not the same as a warm hug or real enthusiasm and passion. If you donate $20 or more to us we will send you Tracy's NEW Online
  Cookbook!  Just send us your Email to amyboettcher@gmail.com . Please help us raise the money we need for car repairs and travel
  expenses in order to go home for a rejuvinating visit this Aug. 2-14, 2015 We went in for an oil change for our 2003 van and the car needs more
  than $500 in repairs to make it safe to drive (but Tracy does love
  adventure). Stopping will add another several hundred dollars to the
  bill to have the brakes fixed but we kind of feel like stopping might
  be even more important than driving, so on the list it goes .  Traveling with a heavy electric wheelchair makes getting hotel
  rooms difficult so we don't always get a choice of using the cheapest
  ones as handicap accessible rooms are usually limited to 2 per hotel
  with only 1 being a roll in shower bathroom (if we are very lucky). 
  The wheelchair is nearly 400 lbs. plus Tracy and temperature control
  is vital for those with ALS (not to mention you can't brush your hair
  out of your eyes or bugs out of your teeth when you can't move so
  having the windows down blowing his golden locks isn't actually as
  romantic and fun as you might think) so we don't get the best gas mileage. Specialty food needs mean we will need a mini refidgerator as well. 
  It's a real adventure traveling across country and dealing with ALS so
  sudden schedule changes often happen extending trips. People often ask WHY? are we willing to put ourselves through all
  this when most people with ALS barely leave their bedrooms much less
  the state? BECAUSE LACK OF QUALITY OF LIFE IS THE #1 KILLER OF ALSers. You will be LITERALLY saving Tracy's life by bringing him the joy and
  adventure of being with friends and family.  He has already improved
  many issues the doctors told us were impossible to heal and he is
  healthier than most at this late stage of his diagnosis so it must be
  working.  Let's keep that going! We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and hope you will share

"In his book, ""Follow Your Gut"", Dr. Rob Knight cited
  several examples of how your gut microbes can affect your mood, the
  functioning of your immune system and inflammatory diseases.  He
  suggests that you consult your physician or pharmacist to recommend
  probiotics that have randomized, placebo controlled trials backing
  them or failing that, you can survey the latest research published in
  scientific journals yourself. I know this is not a simple task for the regular consumer.  A master
  reference of probiotics that you can refer to when making decisions on
  what products to purchase would be a handy thing.  Dr. Knight notes in
  his book, that ""...no patient centered resource exists that
  compiles this data."" If someone were to go ahead and do a google search for this
    information, you'd have to wade through a lot of marketing material
    from companies trying to sell you stuff.   By focusing on the peer
    reviewed scientific literature, we eliminate all the marketing
    material.  The research reports are then read and summarized by our
    scientists (curators) who put it in our reference database in a
    language you don't need to be an expert to undestand . My colleague, Dr. Stephan Schurer, of the University of Miami Medical
  School, and I have built databases as tools for researchers to search
  for new drugs.  We built these by extracting &
  summarizing research published in scientific journals.  We propose to
  use a similar approach to build the probiotics reference. The money we raise will go to purchasing subscriptions to the
  scientific journals (like Journal of Gastroenterology and Gut
  Pathology) so that we can download the relevant research articles. It
  also goes to pay the part time curators who will read the journals and
  enter the key information into the database and lastly it goes to the
  costs of hosting a website and licensing of necessary softwares. Please help us in any way you can.  We greatly appreciate monetary

"On August 24, 2007, Spenser and Mallory Jo Johnson of Oklahoma
  welcomed a beautiful baby girl Zoey into their family, who seemed
  perfect in every way and became the light of their lives. She was a
  very good baby, eating well, sleeping through the night after 2 weeks,
  and extremely happy. However at 3 months of age, on November 29, 2007,
  the Johnson’s had a night that forever changed their lives. At around 1 A.M. the Johnson’s woke up to a faint scream coming from
  Zoey’s bassinet. She seemed perfectly fine, so they laid Zoey on their
  bed to change her diaper before going back to sleep, when something
  very strange happened. Zoey’s head and eyes locked to the left and she
  had her first grand mal seizure. Spenser watched Zoey as Mallory
  frantically called 911. Before Mallory got off the phone it seemed the
  paramedics and police were at their house for the first of many
  emergency room visits. They immediately began searching for a
  pediatric neurologist to diagnose what was happening to their child. Sadly, Zoey’s seizures continued to worsen. She began having
  thousands of myoclonic jerks a day (approximately 100 every 15
  minutes), as well as more frequent grand mal seizures, sometimes
  multiple times a week. During some of those seizures Zoey actually
  stopped breathing. Several MRIs, EEGs, CAT scans and other tests were
  run in efforts to find any kind of solution. They tried numerous
  medications and combinations of medications, as well as the Ketogenic
  diet. Some of these showed promising results, but nevertheless the
  seizures continued as did the testing. After three and a half years and dozens of tests, Zoey was diagnosed
    with Dravet Syndrome on June 23, 2011.
  Dravet Syndrome is a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy, of which
  there is no cure. Constant changes in seizures types, as well as
  behavioral issues, developmental delays, respiratory concerns, and
  numerous other issues are to be expected. So far, approximately only
  600 cases in the world have been reported, Zoey being one. Zoey was on a combination of ten medications, including
  anti-convulsion medications, vitamins, and treatment for her
  respiratory condition. None of these seemed to help her so in 2014,
  Zoey and Mallory moved to Colorado in order to access cannabis oil.
  Zoey has had a huge reduction in seizures since starting cannabis oil
  (Haleigh’s Hope, named after our amazing little friend, Haleigh) but
  sadly is still seizing daily. Despite all that Zoey goes through, she continues to be an amazingly
  happy and brave little girl who loves to sing, dance, read books,
  watch Elmo, and interact with EVERYONE! She pushes everyday to learn
  as much as she can with the help of music, speech, physical, and
  occupational therapies. There hasn’t been a single person that Zoey
  has ever come in contact with that she doesn’t love and encourage to
  play with her. She is the bravest, happiest, most loving child and her
  parents want to give her the best life she can have in spite of Dravet Syndrome. After having the opportunity to spend time with Hope for Haleigh's seizure
  dog Kala, and having witnessed her alert to Zoey’s seizures, Mallory
  came to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for Zoey to have a
  dog of her own. Due to Zoey’s age, her allergens and her respiratory
  issues, the trainer suggested she get a hypoallergenic breed that
  comes from a long line of service dogs. Although it is something their
  family debated on for quite some time, due to it being an added
  expense, there have been times that even though someone is always with
  Zoey, seizures can still be missed. It just takes one to take her
  life. With the help of a seizure alert dog and the proper training,
  that is less likely a chance! On July 14th 2015, Ginger the
  Goldendoodle came to live with Zoey. She is still a sweet little fluff
  ball of a puppy, but the bond was obvious from the beginning. What the
  Johnson’s need now is help funding the formal training that Ginger
  needs to become the perfect seizure alert dog. Ride to Give wants to offer the Johnson’s some peace of mind
    and pay for Ginger’s training but we need your help to do so. Please
    donate and follow Zoey on Facebook here. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the donee

  disorder called Ponto Cerebellar Hypoplasia Type III.  There have only
  been four other documented individuals with the same disorder. Due to his condition, Ben is pretty tiny - he turned 7 on August 13
  but is the size of a two year old.  Finding a sleeping system that
  worked for him took years and we were so lucky to discover a child
  sized recliner that we could adapt for him (he needs to sleep in a
  raised position with harness.)  He has outgrown it though!  Both
  unbelievable and awesome as we have never been sure of what size he
  will ultimately grow to be. We've noticed that his head extends over the top of his chair and his
  sleeping has become more restless.  Due to his condition, he requires
  sleeping medication and night time nurse, the least we can do is
  provide great sleeping conditions for him. Due the decline of the
  Canadian Dollar, we are in a bit of a pickle... the cost of one chair
  is currently the equivalent of what we can buy two for when the dollar
  is stronger.  Unfortunately, purchasing a new recliner is not
  something medical and insurance providers deem as a necessary piece of
  equipment which means it's up to us.  The money we are asking for
  would go directly to purchasing two new recliners for Ben (one for our
  house and one for his dayhome). I know how I feel if I don't sleep well... please help us
  provide comfort for our little anomaly.","3,150",of $2.5k goal,https://fundrazr.com/51271e,Ben Deserves Sleep Too?,25,,Canadian Dollar

"Hi my name is Kathleen, Kat to those who know me. In 2002,
  during my senior year in high school, I was diagnosed with
  Arnold-Chiari malformation (which caused me to miss out on a lot of
  memorable senior activities). I had 4 brain surgeries to correct the
  malformation, as well as having a VP shunt put in my brain as my brain
  was retaining excessive fluid, at times, up to 4 times the average
  person. I then went on to lead a semi-normal life (except for my
  ongoing battle with periodic terrible headaches that came and went
  with barometric pressure change that affects some people with a VP
  shunt). In 2013, I married my wonderful husband Scott, and we had two
  amazing children. Owen, who is 4 years old (and is quite the ladies
  man) and Mackenzie, who is 20 months old (and runs this household),
  and are truly the loves of my life. In February of this year (2015), I woke up one morning and I
  knew something was terribly wrong. I woke up my husband and I said we
  need to go to the hospital. I then called my parents, as they have
  been through this with me before, and let them know that something
  serious was happening and they should start heading towards me because
  they live 2.5 hours away. As soon as possible, my husband took me to
  our wonderful hospital, Hunterdon Medical Center, where after many
  tests they realized that my shunt was over-draining and was causing
  the blood vessels in my brain to shrink. It was what was causing the
  tremendous pain that woke me up and made me realize something was
  wrong. They did not feel that they had the appropriate knowledge or
  the right fit, doctor-wise, for what was going on and I was then
  transferred to Robert Wood Johnson Hospital, which is a teaching
  hospital attached to Rutgers Medical School. I met an amazing
  neurosurgeon named Dr. Tyagi who put a bolt into the top of my head to
  measure my intracranial pressure. After that surgery, and a couple
  days of observing my intracranial pressure, they realized that my
  shunt was in fact over-draining and it was no longer needed. They then
  went in and performed brain surgery to basically shut off my shunt by
  tying off a tube in my neck and removed the drainage tube in my
  stomach which is where the VP shunt drains to. Most recently we have
  discovered that even though, with my shunt deactivated, my body is
  reacting to the hardware that is still left in my head as almost like
  a tumor. My body is attacking it as such, causing radiating pain all
  around the site where my shunt is located. We have recently learned that I have to go back in for one last
  major operation on August 14th to have all of the remaining hardware
  removed from head so there is nothing left for my body to have a
  negative reaction to. After that, hopefully all of the pain will be
  manageable, as anybody who knows anyone that has Arnold-Chiari knows,
  the pain never officially goes away but can be very manageable. I can
  get back to being a full-time mother to my two wonderful children and
  not be bogged down by all of the pain and the stress that the
  malformation and subsequent surgeries, recovery and physical therapy
  has caused. During the recovery of the surgeries from earlier this year we
  acquired many medical bills from many different places between having
  to go to two different hospitals, having three surgeries in total, and
  the subsequent recovery time afterwards, which led to childcare costs
  that we were not financially prepared for and physical therapy costs.
  There will also be another wave of medical bills and childcare costs
  coming after my upcoming surgery, recovery, and physical therapy. We are simply and humbly asking for help in any way,shape or
  form. It is not easy for us to ask for this help financially but we
  have exhausted all of our means and resources and we simply don't have
  any other option than to try to reach out to our friends, family,
  neighbors, strangers and anyone else that might come across this fund
  raiser or anyone that has known someone that has struggled with this
  illness and subsequent financial and physical battle. Thank you in
  advance for anything that you can contribute. Thank you for taking the

"Well. 2015 did not start off being very kind to me and my mother.
  January started with a early morningLife Flight to Topeka Kansas for
  my 84 year old mom. The morning went fast and before noon mom had 3
  stincts and she was in ICU for a few days. Good news is she is doing
  better. Then just when things where settled down  I went for my 
  yearly Mamo. Ok, it was a 90 day check up. Last year a spot was found
  on my left breast so guess what they to found a spot the size of a pea
  on my right breast. Hearing the word Breast Cancer is never, never
  easy to hear. I went numb just to make it to the doctors appointments,
  parking the car, trying to remember what all that they  where telling
  me. The hardest part is doing it all alone. I always wonder about my
  life , how worthless I feel because no one in my family even called me
  during the whole time. Cancer magnifies depression it colors every
  corner of your  life. So on March 20, 2015 I underwent a
  Lumpectomy on my right breast. Three weeks later I started the daily
  Radiation treatments which add up to $2,000.00. I have tried to look
  up all the medical bills but they make my head spin. The Cancer
  treatments are all over, my hair is about a inch long now. It is time
  to pay those medical bills. I would welcome financial help to put them
  behind me. As you can see I am not asking for much considering it all
  started with a 60k hospital billing. I would like to give back to
   the "" Catch A Break"" program. They gave me a card that I
  could use in any way I wanted to help out my situation. I used it for
  transportation expiences for all the treatment visits. The card was
  for $300.00. There is also a organization called"" Cleaning
  for a Reason"" it is based in Texas. They provided cleaning
  services for free, 2 hours a month for 4 months. I can not express how
  good it felt to have those girls come do the things I just coud not do
  at that time. After all this is done my greatist wish if there
  is enough money left over , it would be used to move to Lawrence
  Kansas so I can live closer to the doctors and Cancer Clinic. The
  Cancer that I had was the aggressive fast growing type so they will be
  watching me close for the rest of my life. Stay tuned. E",100,of $8k goal,https://fundrazr.com/312S1b,Breast Cancer Operation and Radiation Treatments,1,,U.S. Dollar

"Mikko was born with gastroschisis, a birth defect that only occurs in
  about 1 of every 5,000 births, and it was detected through a level-2
  ultrasound that his small intestine was protruding through a hole in
  his abdomen. We already had one child who needed surgeries within the
  first year of birth (our other son, Sage, was born with a cleft lip
  and palate), and this was an even more daunting worry. Mikko was born
  nearly two months early on New Year's Eve--he never required
  respiratory assistance, and his weight (5 pounds 1 ounce) was
  impressive for both his gestational age and his condition. However,
  when he was born, the surgeon was concerned about the condition of a
  large portion of the intestine; much of it had not received proper
  blood flow and had been damaged by exposure to the amniotic fluid,
  rendering many parts basically ""dead."" He had a minor
  surgery when he was a few hours old to increase the size of the hole
  in his abdomen, since it had been constricting the intestine, and to
  place a silo in which the tissue would be protected until it was time
  to put it back in his belly and close the hole. During this time we couldn't hold him--we could only place a
  palm gently on his head through the side of the isolette, wondering
  when we would hold him and feed him, things most parents expect and
  think nothing of when their babies are born! The doctors waited a few
  days to see how everything looked after the swelling went down, then
  proceeded to operate, lifting out and measuring the intestine to
  determine how much he had and how much was damaged to the point of
  needing to be removed. The night before the surgery, I went up to see
  him in the NICU and finally asked the unthinkable, but only able to
  choke out the words ""So, depending on how much of the intestine
  is bad, he might not make it?"" And saw the small confirmatory nod
  of the kind doctor that was in the room. And I just cried on her for
  an hour, so fearful of what news I would receive when the surgery was
  finally over. The next day, after waiting feverish hours,the surgeon told me
  that the surgery was successful in many ways. However, a typical
  full-term baby has about 180cm of intestine; Mikko had about 85cm
  total, and 15cm were too damaged and had to be resected. Other
  portions that were partially dead had been repaired. But all was not
  over. In all, Mikko has had four abdominal surgeries, because
  additional resections were needed. At one point it was discovered that some portions of the
  intestine were not even hollow and did not allow anything to be
  processed through them. This was only discovered later as he was able
  to start eating (which happened at about 2.5 months old (he had never
  eaten anything before that--nutrition was provided through TPN
  (basically raw nutrients) pumped into his blood through a central
  line)). He had only been eating for about four days when it was
  discovered that he had a yeast infection in his central line, which
  was particularly worrisome, as a yeast infection in the bloodstream
  can be fatal. Eventually he was able to begin eating again after
  recovering from the yeast infection, but he didn't tolerate it well
  and soon began feeding through a gastrointestinal tube directly into
  his stomach. That was the status quo until a few weeks after he
  finally came home on May 15th, four-and-a-half months after he was
  born. Once he was home for two weeks, doctors encouraged us to begin
  feedings by mouth, and he has been doing pretty well with that. Mikko has had his central line removed, so he no longer gets IV
  nutrition, which is a huge victory, but he has had some intestinal
  bleeding lately, which may require more surgery.  Even when he's
  healthy, we travel to Boston monthly for labs and a clinic visit.  So
  far, his care has totaled well over three quarters of a million
  dollars, and his current medical needs just add to this total; he
  takes 7 medications every day.  Although we have private insurance, it
  doesn't come close to covering all these expenses, and his condition
  requires me to be home with him to offer the care he needs. Your
